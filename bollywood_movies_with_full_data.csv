It is a well-made and entertaining action drama thriller film that tackles some important social issues. The action sequences are top-notch, the cinematography is stunning, and the performances are all excellent, especially those of **Shah Rukh Khan** and Vijay Sethupathi.

I particularly enjoyed the film's social message. It is important to highlight these issues in popular media, and Jawan does so in a way that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.

Jawan contains all of the massy elements that the audience anticipated for. Other flaws can be overlooked (You know what I am talking about) because it does not bore anyone from the beginning to the end. However, as the film contained more massy and over the top themes, I believe Vijay Sethupathi's character was underutilized. The final fight between SRK and Vijay Sethupathi should have been depicted more magnificently."

The story follows Maya (Kareena Kapoor Khan), a single mother embroiled in a murder mystery, and Naren (Jaideep Ahlawat), her enigmatic neighbor who offers his peculiar brand of assistance. As a relentless police officer (Vijay Varma) digs into the case, the lines between suspicion and trust blur, leaving the audience guessing until the very end.

The film's strength lies in its intricate plot, masterfully woven by director Sujoy Ghosh. Each character holds their own secrets, adding layers of intrigue and misdirection. The beautiful backdrop of Kalimpong adds another dimension, its misty hills and quaint charm creating a palpable atmosphere.

The performances are a major highlight. Kapoor Khan delivers a nuanced portrayal of a desperate woman caught in a web of her own making. Ahlawat is captivating as the complex and enigmatic Naren, while Varma shines as the tenacious cop determined to uncover the truth. The supporting cast, too, deserves praise for their believable portrayals.

Jaane Jaan isn't without its flaws. The pacing could be tighter in parts, and some plot points might feel slightly contrived. However, these are minor quibbles in an overall engaging and suspenseful experience.

If you're looking for a well-crafted whodunit with strong performances and stunning visuals, Jaane Jaan is definitely worth your time. Just remember, keep guessing, because the truth might surprise you."

**Little Sophie's giant adventure.**

I did not dislike it, but I thought it was not creative enough. I had seen the British animation and this one retained the same story. Of course, which was originally from the book, but nothing new other than a decent computer graphics. I liked the performance of the little girl who had played the Sophie. She was the only live character until the final stage where more joins her. So she was wonderful along with Mark Rylance's CGI role.

Straight to the point, the adventure begins right away. Sophie, the ten year old orphan girl was snatched by a giant named BFG after she witnessed him wandering on the street through her dorm room window on one midnight. Fearing she might expose the giant's existence, so he had to take her with him to his country. Then there they become very close, but a new threat arises when the other giants suspect of a human's existence in their enclosure. So fighting them, followed by a permanent solution to menace caused by them is what narrated in the rest.

It was like Peter Jackson's 'The Lovely Bones' for Steven Spielberg, I mean the films that did not work for them. I anticipated a major surge in this by the family film specialist Spielber. Because I usually love his film, tell me who won't. From children to adults, his films targets all ages. But if you had seen the old version, then you will lose half the interest. That's definitely won't be the same for the kids, they will love it. There's no harm for watching it once, so go for it.

_6/10_

The animated '89 version of _The BFG_ was a staple of my youth, so naturally I was excited for a Steven Spielberg redo. Unfortunately, I don't think the tale lends itself well to the live action format. That, or the hands making this piece were unable to concentrate the narrative to where it went. In either case, the end product is a film with many tiny endearing moments of nostalgia that at no point come together to create a laudable whole.

_Final rating:★★ - Had some things that appeal to me, but a poor finished product._"

Pathaan delivers explosive action, stunning visuals, and a charismatic duo in Shahrukh Khan and Deepika Padukone. However, the familiar spy-thriller plot and predictable twists leave little room for surprise.

Khan's seasoned charm shines as Pathaan, while Padukone brings both strength and allure to Rubina. Their chemistry fuels the action, which is expertly choreographed and visually impressive. Special effects seamlessly blend with practical stunts, creating a believable spectacle. The tight editing keeps the pace relentless, ensuring you're never bored.

Salman Khan's cameo as Tiger is a crowd-pleaser, hinting at a future shared universe that excites fans. But his brief appearance leaves you wanting more.

The story, while thrilling, relies on recycled tropes and predictable villains. The action, though well-executed, sometimes pushes the boundaries of reality. If you're looking for a thought-provoking experience, Pathaan might fall short.

However, if you crave non-stop action, stunning visuals, and a dose of nostalgia, Pathaan delivers. It's a fun, adrenaline-fueled ride, but don't expect a groundbreaking narrative."

Film starts well and ends well. In the middle, there is a rapid acceleration from being a boy to being a man that misses out on a lot of an explanation as to how he ended up being the person he was. Quite boring in the middle of the film, which is a shame since the young actor was excellent.

**Lost in India, found in Australia!**

Based on the book 'A Long Way Home' that tells the story of a young Indian boy who lost his brother in a railway station in the night and the next morning he woke up thousands kilometers away from home. Not knowing the language or the address and the names of his family, he struggled from various threats in the society. After that he got adopted from an Australian family and the rest of the film revolved on his true identity. Haunted by his past, how he rediscovered his originality was emotionally told.

Very impressive film. The families should not miss it. Even though it is a must see by all ages. I am not a big fan of Dev's performances, even in his debut film 'Slumdog Millionaire'. After that success, he had survived in the film industry doing decent roles, for like a decade. But it was 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' that changed his career. For the first time I liked him very much in that, and again he was pretty impressive in this. The second best performance in his career. Though his part comes only after the half way mark. Yet in that one hour, he did great, particularly in the sentiments.

I was wondering why it was called 'Lion'. And I got answered only just before the end credit. So you should be patient to learn why, if you are yet to see it. It was not until the 90s the India began to see a real change. This story takes place in the mid 80s, only the opening half and those parts were raw and cruel, especially in the eyes of an 8 year old boy. That kid was so good. Just like Jacom Tremblay, a year before who impressed us with his performance from the film 'Room'.

It was a feature film debut for the director and he was wonderful in this attempt. The film splits into two, the first half was about lost and the following half is about finding the road back to the home. Less dialogues, but well written in those necessary parts. The music was good. Only negative was the film was out of depth. Yeah, all the events were like fast forward. If they had focused on details, the narration would have reached at least 3 hours. Especially I wanted the Australian mother's perspective on how she went through to raise those kids.

Now I'm waiting for the 2020. I mean 2008 was SDM, 2012 was LoP and 2016 was this one. The 4 years later, surely there will be another India related western film would come. Despite this film nominated for the 6 Oscars, it had won nothing. That's very sad. Overall, I strongly suggest it. One of the best films of the Year.

_9/10_

**A film of great quality, although marked by the duality of the script and by an excessive emotional appeal.**

This film, for me, has one big point for it and one big point against it. The point in its favor is that it is consistently based on a true story, and as far as I can tell it has been relatively faithful to events. The downside is the fact that it is one of those films that constantly appeals to the public's emotions in order to have some ability to capture our attention. It's not particularly pleasant having to watch a movie that almost forces you to have a box of Kleenex next to you from start to finish.

The script tells the story of an Indian child, very poor, who likes to play with his brother by the train tracks. It so happens that, one day, things go really wrong and Saroo – that's the child's name – ends up trapped in a train that starts moving, taking him to new places, and separating him from his brother and family. Lost, not knowing how to get back in touch, he ends up in an orphanage. There, he will be adopted by an Australian couple, and raised with all the sweetness. But he never forgets his mother and, as an adult, he decides to return to India to find her.

After the success of “Slumdog Millionaire”, it seems that Western cinema is permeable and open to what is best done in Bollywood. This film is not Indian, but it has actors of Indian origin and was well received, with good reviews and a good box office. The film “cleaned up” the Australian film awards and won some BAFTA awards, but lost the Oscars for which it had been nominated and was categorically ignored by the Golden Globes. By the way, while we're at it, it's quite difficult to understand how Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman – the film's protagonists and its main actors – ended up being nominated for Oscars in the Supporting Actor/Actress categories! The only reason I see for this “disqualification” is a possible attempt not to put them on the path of “favorites” to the two figurines, namely Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone and Casey Affleck. In any case, the film was one of the “losers” of that year's Oscars.

The film is solidly starred by Dev Patel, an actor who thus consolidates his status as an international star and who guarantees him a place, if he wants, in American cinema. He only appears near the middle of the film because the story begins in the character's childhood, yet he didn't hesitate and confidently embraced his character with charisma and talent. For her part, Nicole Kidman also does not miss the opportunity to do another job very well done. Less interesting, David Wenham and Rooney Mara did what they could with two rather underdeveloped characters.

One of the film's problems is its duality: developed in two halves (the first focused on the main character's childhood, and the second on her search for her mother, already in adult life), they are quite different from each other. I'm not going to say which one is the best, I think that's something relative and that says more about the viewer than the work, but I can say that I liked the second one better, even if it seems less coherent than the first one, more solid, but also more melodramatic. In this regard, it is necessary to praise the work of the young Sunny Pawar who, with an interpretation of demanding characteristics in which he shone, sustains a part of the film that, without him, would be much less interesting.

Technically, what I most appreciated and feel commended for is the quality of the cinematography, which is clean, sharp, excellently framed and in magnificent colors. The sets and costumes are also very good, and the careful choice of filming locations allows for the inclusion of a beautiful set of landscapes. On this subject, it is worth watching the beginning of this film with attention. The soundtrack and the visual and sound effects complete all this with subtle touches, of great quality.

Though it’s Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman who take top billing, it’s the hugely engaging Sunny Pawar who steals his scenes here as the young Saroo. He’s growing up in rural India with his elder brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) living fairly hand to mouth with their mother (Khushi Solanki) and so the two set off into the city to try to make some cash. Once they arrive, though, the young Saroo is too tired to accompany his brother on his search for work, so he has a nap! Next thing, he’s on a locked train heading through the countryside and when he does eventually manage to get off, nobody understands him nor has heard of his hometown. That’s just the start of some adventures that illustrate how dangerous this society can be as he encounters some fairly malevolent souls on his travels. None of this is especially graphically portrayed, but you don’t need a very vivid imagination to appreciate just what some had in mind for this five year old boy. Fortune smiles on him, though, and to Australia he goes where he is adopted by Sue (Kidman) and husband John (David Wenham) and now morphs into Dev Patel. He’s happy enough there, moves to Melbourne and meets Lucy (Rooney Mara) but he’s becoming more and more restless. Despite his comfortable life and his love for his adopted parents, he still pines for his family in India - so sets about trying to put together what he knows, remembers and can glean from Google maps. Can he ever find home? Patel is also a natural here and he manages to convey well the struggle between his innate need to find out what happened at home with his obligations to his parents, a challenge made especially difficult as Sue is having issues of her own which are explained here without sinking into melodrama. The latter stages are also effectively intercut with flashbacks that seem to be fuelling his desires to return but also offer us an opportunity to appreciate just how loving this family was, despite them having to pinch coal from the train to trade for milk. Kidman only really appears sparingly but she offers an impassioned and often quite poignant performance - but neither she nor Patel really hit the potency of the young Pawar who really does make this worth a watch."

The story is really deep and moving and the performances are plainly good.

A must to be seen.

Perfectly written, amazingly filmed, and surprisingly ended. Definitely, going in my amnisa list.

My rating: 4 out of 10 stars

A young man who survives a disaster at sea is hurtled into an epic journey of adventure and discovery. While cast away, he forms an unexpected connection with another survivor: a fearsome Bengal tiger.

I did not have huge expectations on this movie since it is not exactly my style of movie but nevertheless I have to say that I was disappointed. The movie is certainly quite beautiful to watch, at least part of it. However it is also a movie with a strong theistic agenda. Even though it is, luckily, not really religious/political extremism it is thick and intruding nonetheless. I was expecting Pi to actually learn something during the course of his adventure but he does not. He starts the movie gullible and foolish looking for meaning in life (religion) and the movie ends pretty much in the same way with him claiming that he had faith and therefore he survived. Yet none of the decisions he made was based on faith but simply pragmatical decisions of survival. If anything the movie proved that faith or religion had nothing to do with it.

As I said the movie was, partly, quite beautiful to watch and this is entirely what rendered it the stars that I gave it. For the rest it was a very boring movie. The only mildly entertaining part was the scenes on the boat with Gérard Depardieu playing the very unpleasant cook. As beautiful to watch as they were many of the scenes were quite unrealistic though and had an artificial look to them even when, I believe, it was not intended. We bought the movie because my youngest daughter loves movies about animals but not even she was overly entertained by this movie."

Most importantly this movie dares to put up a fight fighting against old Indian traditions and female prejudice.

Two daughters overcome heavy obstacles to become world famous Indian wrestlers, with the support and motivation of their father and trainer.

It is a very colorful, well-made lighthearted entertainment. The acting is fine, and the characters are relatable. 

A drawback is that it is way too long for a one-night-movie, and should have been made into a mini-series. 

Overlooking the abuse-aspect:
I think it is important to say that personally, I don't agree with most of the methods the father used to train, strengthen and harden his daughters, as a lot of actually was serious child abuse. Their mother also acts as the passive typical enabler. To make it worse, the movie dismisses and jokes about the psychological hurt on the daughters as if it didn't do any damage. In Europe, the father would have been jailed and the kids taken away by CPS.
I think it is a big misunderstanding to glorify abusive behavior, but I guess Indians still have to learn that you can motivate your children without abusing them.

Too long, too predictable and too slow.

After the 161 minutes were over, I didn't hold anything majorly negative about <em>'Dangal'</em> as it does improve as it goes on. However, the first chunk of this film is yawnful, with the story falling to initially inspire - just a guide on how to be a bad parent, in anything. The ending is also pretty cartoonish, with the broom cupboard stuff.

The cast performances are, in fairness, very good. Aamir Khan does great as Mahavir, while Fatima Sana Shaikh (and Zaira Wasim) are impressive as Geeta. Sanya Malhotra (and Suhani Bhatnagar) deserve praise also.

With that noted, It isn't really anything all that fresh for Bollywood sport biopics either. It follows similar beats to 2014's <em>'Mary Kom'</em> and 2015's <em>'Brothers'</em>... even 2011's <em>'Patiala House'</em>.

For me, this 2016 production just feels so bloated and forced that it hampers the, admittedly noteworthy, hearty narrative. The leads are the only strong points to it in my opinion. It has been very highly received by others, so what do I know? Opinions and all that."

A **very** atypical Hindi film in that it is both a fantasy and a horror. It is a well-told fable about greed. Totally worth the watch!

<em>'Tumbbad'</em> is very good folk horror fare. It's a movie that feels unusual for what Bollywood tends to offer, at least the sorta films that I've checked out from this part of the world. Aside from the evidently irremovable music interlude, it felt different - a good different.

I would say that the story gets a bit underwhelming across the middle portion, though the opening chunk and final moments are impressive - both featuring young actors, in my opinion this flick is at its strongest with Dhundiraj Jogalekar and Mohammad Samad (plus Jyoti Malshe, Rudra Soni) onscreen.

The special effects for when the characters are involved with Hastar aren't the greatest, but the film undoubtedly makes it work and it still adds the required creepiness. The practical effects for the 'old woman' are excellent though, very unnerving.

Story-wise it is sturdy, it's fairly straightforward in terms of the message of greed but it works and is portrayed nicely. As noted, if not for a meandering middle I'd be rating this higher. All the same, it's a suitably entertaining movie and one that's worthy of recommendation."

Sirf Ek Bandaa Kaafi Hai is an unsparing and uncompromising courtroom drama based on the life of a God Man and his perfidious adventures. The film is a pretty grounded and honest in terms of its storytelling, which is extremely thought provoking and intense. Baring some moments of dramatizations, the film sticks to facts and doesnt shy away from exposing uncomfortable truths of the case which shook the nation. Deepak Kingrani's dialogues are solid and Arjun Kukreti's cinematography is extremely well done. The score is intriguing and elevates the entire mood of the courtroom drama.

The film is directed by Apoorv Singh Karki, who directed the TVF show Aspirants and its surprising how different is the genre of both. The direction is exemplary of how to try take a well researched case and put life into it through a film. Who better than a marvelous actor like Manoj Baypayee could handle such a purely character driven film, I guess none i can think of. He is a born genius and true gem to the industry and he proves yet again. This man can do no wrong. He just fits into the shoes of PC Solanki and while fighting his own battles of insecurity he never fades off on his conviction. Adrija, actor playing the girl is so good that for most part of the film I thought its real. The moments where she explains the happenings with so much pain and grief literally will give you goosebumps. She has a brilliant future. Vipin Sharma is ruthless and relentless as the defence lawyer while at the same time he agrees with Manoj in the end which is so well showcased. 

Overall, this is one of the finest hindi original films of this year and Manoj Bajpayee deserves another national award for this. A intense, emotionally investing courtroom film which deserves all your attention and comes with my highest recommendation.

A well produced movie with one of the most logical and sensible storylines for movies in this genre.

I went into this with the expectation of a subpar experience, get a few laughs and wrap up.
This blew all expectations away, it starts out slow giving us details and development into the main characters lives before they meet and intertwine, the depth of story, the exploration of what family can mean sometimes, the sacrifices (if you'd call them that) that one makes for family and why someone else cannot see themselves fitting into such a system.
It's crazy because in our own lives, these issues are there, these issues persist,  a lot of people would have smiled and still gone into it, and later down the line explode and say it wasn't what they signed up for.

This goes a step beyond that showing us what can happen if someone decides, ""I'm not a right fit, I have to go"" 
The aftermath of that decision, the subsequent exchange of truth and the final decision, even up to showing a future timeline of the final decision. 

This movie gave me chills, made my heart ache, made me laugh, made me sad, and made me really happy with the ending.

The production was spot on, cinematography was great, actors were awesome, the sound was sublime, the story blended well and it was great!

It lacks the usual family ""hate"" drama we've come to expect from these types of movies and that's not a bad thing by any measure. Though I'll admit the kneeling scene was a bit too dramatic for me, way too dramatic and pointless but I see the necessity of what they did, they had at least five ways they could've spun it but still, in the end it was good.

If there was a scale of 10 to recommend this, it'll be a hearty 11.
Enjoy this,
Cheers."

Arriving in South Africa, his baptism into a sea of bullishness and racism quickly tests his mettle and soon has him on the radar of a General Smuts (Athol Fugard) government that was as yet unused to any sort of challenge from the non-white elements of society. Unafraid to take a beating, or to challenge the cultural norms without own his own caste-driven society, he is swiftly back in India where, flushed with a degree of success, he allies with Pandit Nehru (Roshan Seth) and becomes even more determined to use the sheer size of the dominated Indian population to rebel against the last vestiges of post war Raj. His strategy of non-cooperation sees him incarcerated and separated from those he loved but, again, his patience and determination made even the most formidable of his foes realise that this man was just a bit different - and that he was on a path to a victory that necessitated a dignified, but definite, retreat. The latter part of the story illustrates well that old adage about the difficulties of winning the peace, made more difficult by intolerances of an all together different nature, before a denouement that history dictated for all. Richard Attenborough told a story of his first meeting with Prime Minister Nehru when he was planning this film, and of how that ten minutes of courtesy ended up considerably longer and more beneficial to the look of this beautifully filmed biopic. Using grand scale cinematography that focusses on the vastness and variety of the country, but also using an intimate and really quite tough to watch style of photography as the brutish behaviour towards the colonised was clearly demonstrated. As to the exact nature of the history, I'm not sure that detail mattered so much as the overall assemblage of some of the great from British stage and screen who seemed, by themselves, to offer an heart-felt apology for what had gone on as the sun did start to set on the Empire. There features also a gently supporting effort from Geraldine James's Mirabehn and Candice Bergen also helps the narrative's chronology along as the photo-journalist never far from Gandhi's side. It's long and can be a little sluggish at times, but the sheer participatory nature of this is reminiscent of the epic cinema of the days when crowds were real, cheap, colourful and enthusiastic - and that all adds to the richness of this classy and stylish production. Big screen experiences don't come much more poignant and this is well worth a watch in a cinema if you can."

My Score : 86/100

In the landscape of modern commercial filmmaking, few directors manage to strike a balance between emotion, action, and drama. Siddharth Anand, with his latest venture Fighter, not only meets this challenge but does so with flying colors. Gripping from the start, it offers a rollercoaster of drama, deep emotion, and pulsating aerial action, enticing dog fights all resulting in an experience crafted for big screens. While patriotic elements are skillfully incorporated, the film celebrates friendship and confronts the weight of the past, providing nuanced character portrayals and their dynamics. The strong emotional arc, supported by stellar performances, especially by Hrithik Roshan and Anil Kapoor, leaves a lasting impact. The thrilling screenplay, excellent a and some cheesy dialogues in addition to spectacular VFX enhance key scenes, making Fighter a must-watch cinematic triumph under Anand's proven and evolved directorial prowess.


Balanced Mastery: Fighter, directed by Siddharth Anand, excels in modern commercial filmmaking by skillfully balancing emotion, action, and drama. Yes it has cheesy dialogues , some melodramatic scenes and forced humour at places but the overall product is far more captivating and hence overshadows minor hiccups

Cinematic Rollercoaster: The film grips audiences from the start, offering a thrilling rollercoaster of high drama, deep emotion, and pulsating aerial action, urging a big-screen experience. The VFX is excellent barring the climatic moments. 

Nuanced Storytelling: Fighter sets itself apart with a rich tapestry of storytelling, seamlessly weaving patriotic elements, friendship celebration, and confronting the heavy baggage of the past. The character arcs of Hrithik, Deepika and Anil come to a full circle leaving you overwhelmed with a rewarding satisfaction.

Emotional Impact: A standout feature is the film's strong emotional arc, supported by stellar performances, particularly Hrithik Roshan scorching eyes and his excellent screen presence. He is charming, vulnerable, helpless, revengeful and sarcastic all in a single film. He is just too good. Anil Kapoor and his tensed chemistry with HR is worth watching where Anil dominates. Deepika Padukone, leaving a lasting impact on audiences with her appropriate role.

Directorial Triumph: Fighter stands as a testament to Siddharth Anand's directorial skills, executing a tough film superbly with a perfect blend of action, drama, emotions, scale, and sweet humor, making it a must-watch cinematic experience. He focuses on passing message from time to time in the film that the war is with terrorism and not a particular country. He has evolved brilliantly and his bond with HR shows how deeply he admires the actor and vice versa. Mass with Class shining bright along with Hrithik’s masterclass.

Their first visit to the ruin is not auspicious. Their new neighbour ""Mme. Mallory"" (Dame Helen Mirren) is profoundly disapproving of what she clearly thinks will lower the tone, but he couldn't care less, buys the place and after a refurbishment is ready for opening night. Meantime, his talented and rather dashing son ""Hassan"" (Manish Dayal) plays a much more diplomatic game and befriends her employee ""Marguerite"" (Charlotte Le Bon). She lends him a few books on French cuisine and he starts to experiment. The remainder of the story is entirely predictable, but the writers have invested some time in building some likeable characters whilst incorporating some bloody-mindedness, gentle stereotyping and some sentimentality as we see it's not just the cuisines that can fuse effectively. Dame Helen looks like she's having some fun here and has a genuinely engaging rapport with an on-form Puri - their battle of the curmudgeons is quite entertaining and I did pity the poor old mayor (Michel Blanc), even if he did seem to get a great deal of delicious free food. Dayal also brings a bit of charm to his role and the whole film has exactly the same feel-good factor to it as you'd feel after a fine meal with a decent claret."

No, it's not amazing and no the story is not an emotional journey that makes you both laugh and cry... but.

It's a video-game adaption, and you really can't go in to them thinking they are gonna blow your socks off because really, most of them aren't that great.

The 1994 Jean Claude Van Damme adaption was genuinely awful and that was pretty true to the (no) plot of the video-game so of course they had to do something different here, which I am glad they did, not just fighting all the time but an actual story.

Now of course the story does have a bunch of plot holes (but honestly what video-game adaption that doesn't?) and Chris Klein's acting in particular is pretty dodgy, he plays a tough guy cop which he tried to do again in CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE (2012) but he fails every time.

I like him fine usually but yeah he's not at all believable as a 'bad ass'.

Better is Kristin Kreuk in the lead and Michael Clarke Duncan and Neal McDonough are pretty cool as the bad guys.

And most of the fight-scenes are pretty well orchestrated (except perhaps the dance-club scene) and the cinematography is good and keeps at a good pace plus a pretty good soundtrack as well.

All in all, not a 'great film' but perfectly watchable if you leave your thinking cap on the shelves and just take it for what it is, if you enjoyed ELEKTRA (2005) you should be able to enjoy this... If you didn't (which granted many didn't) then tread carefully I suppose.


**It's impressive how this terrible movie makes the outrageous cheese of the 1994 Van Damme film look like a masterpiece.**

Two stars might be generous for this one, but I had a fun theater experience laughing with my friends at how unabashedly awful this movie was. Movies like this are why video game adaptations have such a bad reputation. Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li tried to make a gritty, more realistic version of the games while simultaneously using every cheesy cliche they could imagine. I can go down the list from there on how bad the acting, stunts, fighting, and costumes were. This movie felt like a bad straight-to-TV movie directed by the B-team at the CW. The crazy thing is that Capcom was heavily involved in this film and still let this disaster see the light of day. Hopefully, it's been long enough for a Street Fighter reboot to make its way to the silver screen once again."

In the ever-evolving landscape of Indian cinema, ""Kalki 2898 AD"" emerges as a groundbreaking spectacle that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and visual artistry. Directed by the visionary Nag Ashwin, this ambitious project weaves together elements of ancient mythology and futuristic science fiction, creating a tapestry that is as thought-provoking as it is visually stunning.

## A Tale Across Millennia

Set in a dystopian future, ""Kalki 2898 AD"" draws its core narrative from the depths of Hindu mythology, specifically the Mahabharata. The film follows the prophesied hero Kalki, played by Prabhas, on a journey to restore balance to a world teetering on the brink of chaos. Ashwin's screenplay masterfully bridges the gap between the ancient and the futuristic, creating a narrative that feels both timeless and urgently relevant.

## Visual Splendor and Technical Prowess

One of the film's most striking aspects is its visual presentation. The production design team has crafted a post-apocalyptic world that is both believable and awe-inspiring. From the gritty, lived-in feel of rebel hideouts to the sleek, oppressive architecture of the antagonist's strongholds, every frame is a feast for the eyes.

The visual effects, while occasionally uneven, often reach heights of breathtaking spectacle. Scenes of futuristic cityscapes and epic battles showcase the film's ambition and the technical capabilities of Indian cinema. Santhosh Narayanan's score complements the visuals perfectly, adding emotional depth and excitement to key moments.

## Star-Studded Performances

The cast of ""Kalki 2898 AD"" reads like a who's who of Indian cinema, and for the most part, they deliver. Prabhas brings a mix of intensity and vulnerability to Kalki, though his character development feels somewhat uneven across the film's runtime. Deepika Padukone shines in her role, bringing strength and emotional resonance to her character.

However, it's Amitabh Bachchan who steals the show with a commanding performance that anchors the film's more philosophical moments. Kamal Haasan's appearance as the antagonist Yaskin is brief but impactful, leaving audiences wanting more.

## Ambitious Storytelling with Room for Improvement

While the film's ambition is commendable, its execution occasionally falters. The pacing in the first half can feel sluggish, with some scenes stretched beyond necessity. The narrative complexity, while intriguing, sometimes verges on convoluted, potentially leaving viewers struggling to keep up with the intertwining plotlines.

However, the film hits its stride in the final act, delivering a series of revelations and set pieces that are truly exhilarating. The climax not only provides a satisfying conclusion to the immediate story but also tantalizes with hints of a larger cinematic universe to come.

## A New Benchmark for Indian Cinema

Despite its flaws, ""Kalki 2898 AD"" represents a significant leap forward for Indian cinema. Nag Ashwin's vision in blending mythology with science fiction opens up exciting new possibilities for storytelling in the industry. The film's willingness to tackle complex themes and its technical achievements set a new benchmark for what is possible in Indian filmmaking.

## Conclusion

""Kalki 2898 AD"" is more than just a movie; it's an experience. While it may not be perfect, its ambition, visual splendor, and the questions it poses about destiny, technology, and the cyclical nature of good and evil make it a must-watch for fans of both Indian cinema and science fiction. As the first installment in what promises to be an epic saga, ""Kalki 2898 AD"" lays a foundation that leaves audiences eagerly anticipating what's to come.

**Rating: 4 out of 5 stars**

Bold, ambitious, and visually stunning, ""Kalki 2898 AD"" heralds a new era for Indian cinema, blending mythology and futurism in a way that's never been seen before on the silver screen.

The mythology that underpins this is a fascinating combination of humanity and adventure that director Nag Ashwin presents entertainingly - if maybe a little haphazardly - here. We start with a battle from history where the defeated ""Ashwatthama"" is condemned to a life of fruitless immortality. His only chance of redemption will come when he is called upon to protect an unborn child - the final reincarnation of Vishnu. At this point we don't know when this will happen, nor what these dangers might be - but skip forward six thousand years and we find a world where the planet is under the control of the ""Complex"". An alien looking enterprise that is systematically robbing the planet of it's nutrients and minerals under the control of the ""Supreme Yaskin"" (Kamal Haasan). Things are especially perilous times for women capable of childbearing as they are being genetically manipulated to produce a serum from their foetus that is implanted into ""Yaksin"" to grant him his own form of (tube free) immortality. Meantime, we are introduced to the legendary bounty hunter ""Bhairava"" (Prabhas) who has something of the ""Han Solo"" to him, and who is working to get the million credits required to get into the ""Complex"". There is one further enigma amongst all of this ordered chaos. She is ""Sum 80"" (Deepika Padukone) as she is pregnant - and naturally, too. Needless to say she is much prized by the ""Complex"" but after some careful planning, she manages to escape the clutches of it's scientists and make a break for ""Shambala"" where legend has it, she will give birth to a very special baby. In hot pursuit is the malevolent commander ""Manas"" (Saswata Chatterjee) who has mobilised an whole army of unsavoury types to track her down - and with a prize of 5 million for the person who delivers her, well ""Bhairava"" is soon in on the chase too. If he can help this woman, perhaps ""Ashwatthama"" can fulfil his destiny? Now this is long, and at times it loses it's way a little with the oddly positioned entertainment numbers spliced into the drama, but for the most part - particularly after the interval - this is quite an action packed hybrid of Hindu folklore combined with elements of ""Dune"" (especially much of the scoring), ""Avatar"" and featuring a guest appearance from ""Skeletor's"" big chair from ""Masters of the Universe"" towards the end. I wouldn't have said the acting is all that remarkable, but Prabhas provides a charismatic effort, the dialogue generally works efficiently and the production design is creatively effective at mixing the futuristic with the ancient. There's no getting away from it's reliance on CGI, and that doesn't always work, but the story is sound and clearly designed to give us more down the line as the ancient gods line up against the pillagers of the planet - with the very future of mankind to play for.

Kalki 2898 AD is copy & paste scenes from Mad Max + Star Wars + Dune + Blade Runner 2049.

The budget of this movie is 600 crores & still it has worst VFX.

**And let's not forget that the lead actor of this movie Prabhas still can't act to save his life.**

This movie has very weak & generic story, screenplay is pointless, and totally cringe/amateur acting from lead actor. Enough with the too many slow-motion scenes. Too many pointless cameos. Kalki 2898 AD is totally disappointment. Don't Waste your money on this.

**Kalki 2898 AD is another ""Miss Fire"" for Prabhas!**

An epic journey based on the New York Times bestseller.,6.97,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/5JnmseS3DZ6ad2VMbrnbGCs8Rst.jpg,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @
https://www.msbreviews.com

Even though The White Tiger isn’t exactly the first review I published in 2021, it was the first film I watched at the start of this new year. I really didn’t know what to expect. I’ve never seen anything from any actor involved in the movie or from the writer-director, Ramin Bahrani. I still follow the “trailer-free” philosophy that I established back in 2017, so my knowledge about the actual story was close to null. Nevertheless, all of these details left me quite excited, to be completely honest. Starting 2021 with a 100% blind watch (something I sincerely appreciate) is an excellent way of beginning a year that I hope will be better than the previous one (it shouldn’t be that hard).

From the get-go, it’s clear that Bahrani will use his film in an enlightening, educational manner to teach its viewers about India’s sociopolitical stratification (caste system) and its economic consequences. The viewer follows Adarsh Gourav’s character, Balram, who’s trying to get away from the dated traditions and become a real entrepreneur. I rarely love straight-up political movies, even when these follow the satire route. On par with religion, these are two matters that I’ve been avoiding talking about my whole life. From corruption to wars, there are literally hundreds of reasons that justify my detachment from these topics.

With that said, The White Tiger holds several significant messages concerning poor families (low caste) who must work hard in unimaginable conditions just to survive, specifically in India. It also approaches ideas such as arranged marriage and the unbreakable master-servant bond. These cultural lessons on India’s sociopolitical and socioeconomic structure are by far the most interesting aspect of the entire screenplay, and Bahrani does a fantastic job of conveying this awareness to the audience in a compelling manner. With the help of Paolo Carnera (DP), the story is filmed at ground-level, putting the viewers in the dirty, smelly, impoverished streets of different places across India, generating a realistic atmosphere. Chad Keith’s production design is also vital to create that immersive Indian environment.

Despite the wonderful technical aspects, Bahrani’s script is packed with an overwhelming succession of narrative events that fail to further develop the protagonist or impact the story, especially from the mid-point of the film onwards. Some sequences are similar to previous ones, ultimately making the movie feel repetitive while not moving the plot forward. Unfortunately, it really feels like the viewers could miss a couple of minutes here and there and not miss anything genuinely relevant. Therefore, Bahrani’s flick becomes overlong and slower than what it needs to be, consequently affecting the viewers’ attention, which might result in some of the critical messages getting lost in the transmission, mainly the economic one. Balram’s narration helps, but Bahrani could have found a better (and more logical) justification for this storytelling detail.

In addition to this, it’s a film that depends on the viewers’ knowledge about India and their interest in learning more about it. In my case, The White Tiger didn’t surprise me with any information - which doesn’t help the entertainment value - but its visuals helped me connect what I knew to something quite palpable. I do want to end on a positive note, though. The unknown cast is phenomenal, but the biggest praise must go to Adarsh Gourav’s first lead role. Balram is a well-written character who will definitely connect with many viewers all around the world.  Gourav shows quite a good range, demonstrating his comedic timing and funny expressions, but also an emotional side that truly elevated some of the best scenes in the entire movie.

The White Tiger employs the English and Indian languages to educate viewers about India’s sociopolitical and socioeconomic system by following Adarsh Gourav’s character, who narrates the largest email ever about his life.

Even though The White Tiger isn’t exactly the first review I published in 2021, it was the first film I watched at the start of this new year. I really didn’t know what to expect. I’ve never seen anything from any actor involved in the movie or from the writer-director, Ramin Bahrani. I still follow the “trailer-free” philosophy that I established back in 2017, so my knowledge about the actual story was close to null. Nevertheless, all of these details left me quite excited, to be completely honest. Starting 2021 with a 100% blind watch (something I sincerely appreciate) is an excellent way of beginning a year that I hope will be better than the previous one (it shouldn’t be that hard).

From the get-go, it’s clear that Bahrani will use his film in an enlightening, educational manner to teach its viewers about India’s sociopolitical stratification (caste system) and its economic consequences. The viewer follows Adarsh Gourav’s character, Balram, who’s trying to get away from the dated traditions and become a real entrepreneur. I rarely love straight-up political movies, even when these follow the satire route. On par with religion, these are two matters that I’ve been avoiding talking about my whole life. From corruption to wars, there are literally hundreds of reasons that justify my detachment from these topics.

With that said, The White Tiger holds several significant messages concerning poor families (low caste) who must work hard in unimaginable conditions just to survive, specifically in India. It also approaches ideas such as arranged marriage and the unbreakable master-servant bond. These cultural lessons on India’s sociopolitical and socioeconomic structure are by far the most interesting aspect of the entire screenplay, and Bahrani does a fantastic job of conveying this awareness to the audience in a compelling manner. With the help of Paolo Carnera (DP), the story is filmed at ground-level, putting the viewers in the dirty, smelly, impoverished streets of different places across India, generating a realistic atmosphere. Chad Keith’s production design is also vital to create that immersive Indian environment.

Despite the wonderful technical aspects, Bahrani’s script is packed with an overwhelming succession of narrative events that fail to further develop the protagonist or impact the story, especially from the mid-point of the film onwards. Some sequences are similar to previous ones, ultimately making the movie feel repetitive while not moving the plot forward. Unfortunately, it really feels like the viewers could miss a couple of minutes here and there and not miss anything genuinely relevant. Therefore, Bahrani’s flick becomes overlong and slower than what it needs to be, consequently affecting the viewers’ attention, which might result in some of the critical messages getting lost in the transmission, mainly the economic one. Balram’s narration helps, but Bahrani could have found a better (and more logical) justification for this storytelling detail.

In addition to this, it’s a film that depends on the viewers’ knowledge about India and their interest in learning more about it. In my case, The White Tiger didn’t surprise me with any information - which doesn’t help the entertainment value - but its visuals helped me connect what I knew to something quite palpable. I do want to end on a positive note, though. The unknown cast is phenomenal, but the biggest praise must go to Adarsh Gourav’s first lead role. Balram is a well-written character who will definitely connect with many viewers all around the world.  Gourav shows quite a good range, demonstrating his comedic timing and funny expressions, but also an emotional side that truly elevated some of the best scenes in the entire movie.

The White Tiger employs the English and Indian languages to educate viewers about India’s sociopolitical and socioeconomic system by following Adarsh Gourav’s character, who narrates the largest email ever about his life. Despite the somewhat silly setup, Ramin Bahrani delivers an enlightening, interesting narrative with dozens of relevant messages regarding India’s culture and the incredibly challenging way of living of most of its population. Gourav offers a brilliant performance (debut in a lead role), elevating a well-written, relatable character who goes through an unbelievable life story surrounded by an immersive production design and terrific camera work, creating a realistic environment. Unfortunately, this Netflix’s flick is overwhelmed by an absurd amount of gradually unimpactful narrative events, unnecessarily extending the runtime and hurting the overall pacing.

Humanity’s worst kept secret is that the world of wealth and privilege go hand in hand, and that idea is explored in “The White Tiger,” the big screen adaptation of Aravind Adiga‘s 2008 prize-winning novel. The author wrote the book as a critique of the state of things in his home country, but the situation in India and the story’s themes of corruption within the political system and the separation of the elite and working classes is universally relatable to most citizens across the globe.

Balram Halwai (Adarsh Gourav) narrates his rise from poor villager to successful entrepreneur in modern India, starting with a flashback narrative when he was a child living in the slums. He has been ambitious his entire life, learning English and seizing opportunity whenever a chance arises. Balram talks his way into becoming a personal driver for the wealthy Ashok (Rajkummar Rao) and his wife Pinky (Priyanka Chopra), a couple who have returned to India after living in America for many years, but finds himself at the beck and call of the more corrupt associates of the family. They’re up to no good, paying off politicians and often treating Balram like trash. But just when he thinks he’s made himself indispensable to the family, they betray him in a way that could ruin his life forever. On the verge of losing everything, Balram rises up against this inequality with a vengeance, and it’s shocking what he must do to truly become free.

The film has a moral complexity that’s provocative and disturbing. Balram first declares that India’s caste system is divided into two categories: “men with big bellies, and men with small bellies.” It’s one of the simplest ways of thinking about this division, but he’s not wrong. As the man is exposed to big city ideas and becomes envious of the upper class lifestyle, he begins rejecting centuries-old traditions and cutting ties with his family and the village back home. Capitalism consumes him, and he’ll even entertain murder to get ahead.

The story gives a compelling look into the working class and societal changes in modern-day India, where those in charge aren’t too keen on investing in things to help the poor. As the “have-nots” begin speaking up and letting their ambition be known, it causes a conflict with those at the top. “Rich men are born with opportunities they can waste,” as Balram says. Corruption is everywhere. Sound familiar?

Director Ramin Bahrani doesn’t turn an eye to the worst parts of his lead character, making Balram a person you both love and loathe at different points in the story. It’s part of the reason “The White Tiger” is so intriguing, and it adds a layer of relatability to the ongoing class struggle in a globalized world.

What has the killing of a man ever actually achieved? It never makes anything any better. It serves to galvanise both sides and retrench enmities and bitterness that can take many years to wain. This film depicts one such story. That of a man who also passionately believed it was acceptable to take a life. His motives appear demonstrably justifiable as we watch this beautifully shot, frequently harrowing, depiction of the lead up to the atrocity of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919. It is told through the eyes of the assassin - Udham Singh (Vicky Kaushal) and over the course of the next two hours, we are exposed to the events that drove a decent man to commit the ultimate sin, and to pay the ultimate penalty. Whilst it does take a little while to get going, Shoojit Sircar develops a story replete with conflicting emotions, that offers a critique on the prevailing imperial attitudes and on the very value of life itself. It clearly, and succinctly, exemplifies the cruelty visited on people who just wanted to be left to govern themselves; and of the shockingly arrogant superiority complex of those who believed these people to be little more capable of such aspirations than pets, or sheep. The film looks stunning - the imagery of India from grand scale to violent aftermath; the settings in London - all add hugely to the gutsy integrity of this story. As with so much about the man himself, much is still be be made public about these events and about the true intent of the vice-regal, or British, governments in making an example of these unarmed protesters - but this surmising offers an entirely plausible assessment of man's inhumanity to man - and sadly, over 100 years on from this - we appear to have learned little about the merits of killing another human being - friend or foe.

It's quite the captivating story. Sadly, humanity seems to learn nothing from history, and so we are doomed to the fatal repetition of the past. This is one story that should have taught us a lesson, yet governments all over the world suppress and repress the truth. The non-linear film seems a little scattered in organization but picks up all the dangling pieces by the final reel."

First, I thought that it would be an entertaining movie, but it was only after watching the film that I realized that for the very first time, in case of an ACTION movie, I was wrong. The film would have been entertaining if there was something more like action. There is overdose of romantic and dramatic scenes which draws us towards tedium.

 The songs are good, but Due to their poor placement ,they do not look entertaining at all. Performances have been the worst on the part of each and every actor. The action scenes are just OK, but that is not enough. Something is missing.

Besides, the film also falls flat in terms of a crisp editing. But I am sure that if the editors had used their scissors in the film, 90% of the film would have gone out.

 On the whole, Ek Tha tiger fails as a film.It is a big,big,big disappointment. Watch it if you want to be disappointed.

These two films have a very special place in my heart.

Would I watch it again? Absolutely! Would I make my friends watch it? Definitely.

Well hats off to John Madden for managing to reassemble the cast from the first film from four years earlier, and for securing the sparing services of Richard Gere but I'm afraid the rest of this is all a poor cousin. With the hotel now more successful, ""Sonny"" (Dev Patel) and ""Mrs. Donnelly"" (Dame Maggie Smith) are in the USA trying to seek funding for them to expand, and to buy the former women's palace for their next venture. Returning, and expecting an inspector to come and evaluate their business they greet the arrival of writer ""Chambers"" (Gere) and of new guest ""Lavinia"" (Tamsin Greig) in slightly different manners - and that's the first mistake for ""Sonny""! The first film had a freshness to it, they (and we) were are all exploring a new life with new opportunities in a new bustling city: this is a much less joyful affair. Everyone appears to be looking towards the end; the characters are much flatter and slightly more depressed. The mischievous characterisations from Ronald Pickup and Celia Imrie have entered a rather uninteresting cul-de-sac. Familial discord between Sonny, his fiancée and his mother is all just a bit too convoluted and the story just, frankly, runs out of steam. Patel exudes charisma, he does way more to carry this than any of others and in the end comes up with quite a decent bit of dancing too. It's colourful and it's doesn't hang about, but Dame Maggie, in particular, has lost much of her curmudgeonly charm and Dame Judi really rather simpers through the film with little of the spark we saw before. To be honest, I'm not really sure the first film really merited a sequel at all. This one is really not very memorable and Richard Gere's character adds very little indeed."

Never mind scraping around for a few old iPhones and some costume jewellery, their enthusiastic young leader ""Fani"" (Raghav Juyal) decides to take them hostage. Now this is probably his biggest mistake as it turns out that the man's daughter ""Tulika"" (Tanya Maniktala) is the love of the life of our intrepid commando ""Amrit"", and when events unfold becoming more violent, and tragic, this unleashes in him a feverish desire for retribution that proves the training at the National Commando School of India is extremely effective.

This isn't a film you go to see for the dialogue - there isn't really very much, and what there is doesn't really matter. This is simply an end to end, action-packed festival of acrobatic carnage that isn't necessarily the most realistic - I think in real life, everyone would have been dead from the deadly kukri blows far earlier, but Nikhil Nagesh Bhat allows the film to build the tension to quite a crescendo. Sure, some of the combat scenes are a little too choreographed and repetitive, and I doubt it would ever encourage you to want to travel on Indian Railways, but this is every inch as good as it's Hollywood equivalents. Be warned - the violence is about as graphic as it gets, but I enjoyed it and wouldn't be surprised if Lakshya starts to appear in more films targeted more at the West.

Good god like 45 minutes of the same guys fighting. There are some cool deaths but how many times can I see a guy get a khurki or whatever knife stuck in their shoulder before they die. Everyone fights at such randomly skilled levels depending on the scene. It's so fucking long and boring."

While shooting, Bhuvan Gowda, the cinematographer used to carry around 40kgs of the camera and its accessories on top while canning the sequences in windy and dusty region. The gigantic sets used to come down crashing after heavy wind and rains yet the Art Director, Shivakumar used to go back in erecting the same sets as they stood earlier. Yash, used to give multiple retakes with no sign of fatigue or feeling bored in that dust bowl.

KGF will be made in two chapters. The chapter 1 is out and at the outset, it traces with pre-historical chronology world of events letting the audience know the importance of owning Gold and the battles for it. The chapter 1 deals with micro level of unorganized crime, Mafia and underworld. The Chapter 1 depicts about the greed and the race for one-up man-ship within many characters in getting the control of Goldmine, KGF. To enter into the Macro level of an orbit of world crime syndicate, one has to clear his way at the micro level. The dirt has to be cleaned to make way to the top. The chapter 1 ends at the doorstep of Chapter 2, which is meant to open for the Triangular battle between International mafia (for Gold), The interruption of India’s Govt and Rocky (who valorously emerges out of KGF slavery, as a Messiah)

The film is narrated through the author’s (Played by Anantnag) First hand experience to a News Editor (Played by Malvika Avinash) As his book gets banned by the Central Govt. He traces the journey of rocky from his birth to establishing himself as the feared crime lord from Mumbai docks to Bangalore to finally his destined place KGF. The mother sentiment is well crafted and placed appropriately throughout the film. Though the story line is predictable and replicates Ugramm template. In KGF also just like Ugramm, many characters get introduced and thus challenges one’s memory to remember the count of characters. Yash’s introduction in an elaborated action sequence keeps everyone engaged and makes glued to the screen. KGF falters at few places in the first half. Yash-Srinidhi scenes could have been better. The army of supporting characters may be revealed more in the Chapter 2. It’s the second half, which meets the expectation and ends with retaliating climax, leaving multiple threads open only to be tied later in Chapter 2 on another day.

KGF, from start to finish, is full of high octane action sequences, The dialogues are sharp and effective, Music is average, but gets compensated through an outrageous BGM (some influence from the soundtrack of Hams Zimmer’s “The Oil”(Dunkirk).

On Technical front: The captain of KGF mines, Prashant Neel, the Director should take a bow for bringing his vision on screen. Editing is very sharp, multiple scenes are played parallel and also intellectually blurred at few places to showcase that the character had no idea about the things to come. Ravi Basrur’s music is a downer, but his BGM raises the milieu in all the sequences. The cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda is top-notch and world class (he will get all the awards if nominated functions PAN India level in 2019). The never say die attitude of Art Director Shivakumar should get all the accolades for erecting such massive sets of mines, in the midst of the dust bowls. KGF has used 90% of sets and just 10% of VFX for filming. KGF- Chapter 1 sets the stage for a macro-level showdown in chapter 2."

Mimi is precisely one of those movies.In 2013 an American couple is looking for a surrogate in India to bear their baby. The research isn’t easy, but new possibilities appear when they meet Bhanu, the driver. After a couple of funny misunderstandings, Bhanu learns what they need, and the solution is Mimi. Will Bhanu succeed? Is Mimi going to be a movie’s star? Will the Americans have their baby? And what are we going to learn? All the details at SpotaMovie.com

This movie is so highly rated that I expected much more from it. I was a little disappointed. I've enjoyed most of Laxman Utekar's work as a cinematographer, but with Mimi, the screenplay and directing are just not quite tight enough for modern cinema. Not that the movie isn't enjoyable. It is easy to watch and enjoy. The premise  and conflict are reasonable. (Although I understand this practice involving foreigners is now illegal anyway.) I just expected more from Utekar I guess."

It is in the same class as Kurasawa's RAN. It is a brilliantly written screenplay, and both directed and performed at the very highest level. Bhardwaj has taken quite a bit of liberty with the sequence and story line, but not so much that it is unrecognizable from the Bard's work.

Those who didn't liked Knight & Day, this movie is not for them. Bang Bang serves nothing new, just scene by scene copy of K&D. The plus points, for which film did good business in both India & overseas is the action sequences! Bang Bang surpass K&D in terms of action sequences. It has some brilliant stunts & actions which is a reason of films decent success (decent because though film collected very well but the budget of the film was also very high, film was a success for producers but lost for the distributors unfortunately). Hrithik Roshan was brilliant! He had performed very well and did a on par job with Tom Cruise in the original version. Katrina Kaif looked beautiful and glamorous as always. Villain's Arshad Warsi & Dany Dengzongpa done good job! Especially Dany was too good as a villain but unfortunately his role was too short to make an impact. 

Overall if you watched K&D, just skip it else you are a huge action film fan. Or if you hadn't watched K&D and has nothing much to do, you can give it a try. My rating 2.5/5"

But Raj is not here to only bring back love in the students' hearts, he has some unfinished business with Gurukul

This is a romantic/drama, but in the Bollywood way, there are lots of funny moments. The story is both the developing love stories of the new students, and the story of Raj (and also Kake - Anupam Kher in a very funny role). It's very impressive how they fit 4 love stories and an opposition of character in the same movie. Acting is astounding by SRK and Bachchan, and strong from the newcomers. The dance numbers and songs are so great too.
Very recommended.

Cheesy."

Starring Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bachchan, BomanGrover, Sonu Sood & Vivaan Shah in lead, _Happy New Year_ is made to tickle your funny bones. Film has been directed by Farah Khan. Though she has only 4 films in her director career,SRK starred in 3 of them and resu  is blockbuster every time! Even HNY broke all the first weekend record of Dhoom 3 and crossed 100 crore in its first weekend which is a big feat for a Bollywood movie. 

Back to the film, this film is about revenge of Charlie, Charlie's father had been killed by Charan Grover played by Jackie Shroff! So made a masterplan of robbing diamonds from the ""Shalimar Vault"" which can be open only by Charan Grover and his son Vicky Grover's finger prints. But to enter the Vault they must participate a dance championship called WDC (World Dance Championship). Why they need to participastanow Charlie's team nominated for the WDC, can they rob the diamonds etc, you will get all the answers by watching the movie! But should you watch this 3 hour long heist thriller? Yes!! Because inspite of the long runtime, film never let you feel bore. Film is funny & first of its kind! Its amazing how a heist film can be so hilarious. First part is funny and has scenes to tickle your funny bones, second half is brilliant! Heist sequence too was superb! Acting wise Shah Rukh Khan stands out to be the best. The role was a cakewalk for an actor of his caliber. Others too did well job, especially Abhishek Bachchan as Nandu Bhide (he had double role) was damn funny. SRK-Deepika's chemistry sizzles once again. 

Overall a nice and rocking entertainer! Just go with a free & fresh mind and have some ""ROFL!"" My ratings would be 7/10."

Considering this filmmaker from the B movies, this is not a bad one, probably it may remain as his best work for sometime. Definitely not a great horror film either, yet the rating it has received is a very low. The title says everything, but there are other things in the narration to get engaged with. Obviously a bit slow, and patches between the scenes should have been developed better. But overall film was slightly above average if you welcome a blend between two different cultures and themes.

It was the tale of a western couple who settled in Mumbai, but the film opens with their plan to start a family and later it moves to six years forward. Now they're grieving with their son's death, especially the mother with a guilty feeling. Then she comes to know a place to make a contact her dead son and to say proper goodbye. But what follows is the supernatural chaos in the house and finding a way to fix everything is the remaining film to reveal.

The concept was really wonderful, but the film was designed to be not scary or maybe those parts were just a cliché. You know those dead guys in the make-ups try to scare you stuffs. The story wise, it is refreshing, but should have been added more to it to make further interesting. It was just a 90 minute film, yet feel somewhat lengthy. Actors were decent, the locations were okay, the production was much better and the overall film was acceptable kind. Except easily predictable scenes, not bad for a casual watch.

6/10

This is one Oliver who doesn't need an army.

Directed by Johannes Roberts and Roberts co-writes the screenplay with Ernest Riera. It stars Sarah Wayne Callies, Jeremy Sisto, Sofia Rosinsky and Suchitra Pillai.

Still struggling to come to terms with the death of her young son, Maria (Callies) is told of an Indian ritual where she can say goodbye to her son one last time, under one condition. The condition is that the conversation will be on the other side of a door - a door which simply must not be opened...

There were far worse horror films than this released in 2016, that's not to say this should be a selling point for The Other Side of the Door, but it at least is effective in what it does. The problems really are that it's all very cliché ridden, but how many horror films do not have clichés anyway? This is one for those who are just after a few genuine scares, some creeping dread like atmosphere, and a nifty ending. It doesn't tread any new ground, and it comes off like the bastard child of Ringu and Pet Sematary, but sometimes a safe horror with clichés is all you need for a decent night in with the lights off. 6.5/10"

My Rating : 80/100

Sriram Raghavan unique style of presenting dark humour and crime is separate genre in itself. After films like Andhadhun, Badlapur made for matured audience , he delivers a Christmas project which is thoroughly enticing and entertaining. Merry Christmas is satisfying one night story of 2 strangers attracted towards each other which turns out to be a bloody thriller post interval. The film falls in a niche category of slow burn thrillers which demands attention and not for people looking for engagement in every frame. The first half is purely a setup in progress for a wild ride coming in 2nd half. Powered by brilliant Vijay Sethupathy, a formidable Katrina and a tightly edited runtime , Sriram Raghavan delivers a film which has a solid heart and fitting climax which makes worth all the wait.The music is magical by Pritam especially the songs Nazar Teri Toofan by Papon and Raat Akeli Thi by Arijit. Beautifully integrated into the screenplay. 

I was apprehensive about  pairing of Vijay and Katrina but how beautifully and organically the romance is presented in the first half is what makes Raghavan Sir a celebrated director. Vijay Sethupathy with his distinct sarcastic humour and sharp expressions wins me over again. While Katrina has shown great command over her hindi dialogues and has also given a performance she would later be proud of. Vinay Pathak and Pratima Kannan in an extended cameo make the film interestingly exciting towards the climax. Baby  Pari Sharmaos adorable. 

Overall, there are few things to keep in mind before you watch Merry Christmas. Don't compare with Andhadhun, its an entirely different story. Don't completely tag it as a thriller, its a romantic comedy which turns into dark thriller. The film needs more mature audience to watch it. It wont work for everyone but I really appreciate the neo noirism integrations by Raghavan Sir with multiple twists and wow monents in 2nd half.

I had to make a conscious effort to move, after sitting motionless through the climax and the end credits. I don't recall seeing a darker Indian movie. When the movie ended, I felt UGLYNESS in my soul. That's not supposed to be a good thing, but I imagine that was the purpose. 

The story revolves around a 10 year old girl who goes missing. Her biological father is a struggling actor, her mother is an alcoholic and her husband is a top cop. Then there's a guy whose the actor's friend and is a casting director. There are a few more notable characters. The central characters are trying to figure out the whereabouts of the girl, but they all have bones to pick with each other. Here the title comes into play. What's uglier than the supposed kidnapping of the girl is that they all have their vested interests and that they're more keen on satisfying those then actually finding the girl. The journey to the climax brings out the ugliness within these flawed characters. And it's not one for the faint hearted. 

Anurag Kashyap is my favorite Indian director of this day and age so I'm always a bit biased towards his movies but Ugly has got to be his finest work till date. The story isn't flawless, but the direction is. Mr Kashyap succeeds completely in bringing out the ugliness of his characters, who could easily be breathing and walking human beings amongst us, which makes it all the more chilling.

The acting by entire cast was superb. Each and every one of them brought their characters alive on screen. You could feel strongly for them, hate, sorrow, pity and a lot more. The screenplay and editing is tight, dialogs too good and natural. I felt there were 2-3 loopholes and if not for them, the actual story could've been perfect.

All in all a definite 9 out of 10 for me.

His daughter Taani (Anushka Sharma) is soon to be married, the father presents him as his favourite student, but as a young energetic woman she doesn't even see him. Tragedy strikes as the future husband is killed in a car accident. The father is devastated and sent to the hospital. He asks for Surinder and Taani and makes them promise to get married so that she is taken care of by someone he trusts. Taani comes to live with Surinder but barely speaks a word to him, despite his extreme gentleness and attempts to make her laugh. One day she comes on an advertisement for dance lessons. She asks Surinder to do it. He doesn't care about it at first, then accepts. He sees improvement in her mood, but she doesn't open to him. He then disguises to get into the dance lessons, but the school gets into a dance competition and couples are (randomly?) chosen.

I saw maybe 300 Bollywood movies, most being romantic comedies. This one begins as a drama, then the mood gets lighter as the movie goes on. The characters are very likeable from the start, and the story development is mostly slow to allow to know them better. The scenery is only the small town they live in, so nothing fancy there, only the dance course is somewhat more colored, and improves a bit as the tension grows.

But what makes the movie is the stunning performance of SRK, playing both a shy guy in a strange situation and the bold dancer trying to warm Taani's heart. And Anushka Sharma (in her first role) is totally stunning, she plays this broken young woman in such a moving way, either very sad, a bit angry, lost among other people ...
A special sequence with lots of guests (Kajol, Rani, Bipasha, Lara Dutta ...) brings a happy moment.
Very recommended."

Two cops from Mumbai are assigned to the case.",6.1,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/rUVTM5EQUQ2I0fcfE46AkvBYWae.jpg,"Dhoom 3 is the third of the well acclaimed blockbuster ""Dhoom"" action series. The movie stars renowned Bollywood stars Aamir Khan and Abhishek Bachchan in a legendary battle between a vigilante and a no-nonsense policeman. The film opens in the 1990’s to a show known as The Great Indian Circus. The show starred flashy dancers, dangerous stunts and most importantly a young magician established as the Iqbal Khan’s (the owner) son Sahir.  The show was under a great deal of pressure from its lender as it was unable to make payments on its loan.  Per the banker’s demand, the show was ordered to be shut down and Iqbal Khan committed suicide immediately.
	The film then fast forwards to present day, Sahir (Aamir Khan) is an adult and has formulated a plot to avenge his father’s death by planning and executing robberies against the bank that once closed his father’s circus. After one robbery, ACP Jai Dixit (Abhishek Bachchan) is summoned on the case. After a case of cat and mouse, epic chase scenes, and another robbery Jai learns the truth behind Sahir’s robberies. An epic plot twist reveals that Sahir is actually a twin to his autistic brother Samar which explains the inherit “magic” behind Sahir’s avoiding the police during the chase. Undercover police work and a fifteen minute police chase later the film fittingly ends when Sahir and Samar apparently commit suicide by jumping off a bridge much like their father did. The film lives up to the hype led by the precursor movies in the series, giving the viewers epic action scenes, major plot twists and countless dance numbers that Bollywood film patrons love so much. 
   This action film has same intrinsic values and plot as the iconic film Deewaar. The motives of both Sahir and Vijay can be ascribed to the underlying resentment and anger of  young men, or the proverbial “angry young man” made so famous by Deewar’s leading man, Amitabh Bachchan. The young men both took it upon themselves to seek their own justice against what they deemed was unfair and unjust to their family. Both films stress the increased importance on family values that one would see in any other typical megahit Bollywood film. The basic plot of Dhoom 3 is the revenge of the twin sons against the bank for being the cause of their father's death, albeit indirectly.  In Deewaar, Vijay’s father is victimized by a corrupt businessman and leaves town, leaving the family to fend for themselves, and Vijay spends his formative teen years and early adulthood fighting for his rights.  The impact of the victimization of the fathers on the children was evident in both films. The endings are also both inherently tragic as both angry young men die in pursuit of their own justices because they operated outside the law. Historically, in Bollywood rivalries and traditions are multi-generational and these two movies are no exceptions. “[Vijay]… unlike hard core villains, values family relationships… he is an exemplary older brother (as a child he worked so hard so that his brother could be educated” (Thomas). In both films the villain is not one true villain but rather someone who is fighting for their own justice having experienced one in the past. “… he [Vijay] is also good enough to be the focal hero” (Thomas). This runs a direct parallel to Sahir as the triumph of the law (Abhishek Bachchan) over the criminal (Aamir Khan), even if the crime is strangely understandable and maybe justifiable.  There have been rumors of Dhoom 4 and a potential leading villain role of Shah Rukh Khan as well.  We will just have to wait and see."

The story starts strong, flows smoothly into the second act, and ends with a satisfying climax. While the themes are interesting, they don’t get explored as deeply as they could have. The pacing has some slow moments, but if you’re binging, it’s not a big issue. Predictability is there, but that’s common in movies these days.

The cinematography is the film’s strongest point. The red-tinted visuals create a haunting, dreamlike atmosphere that fits the story well. Editing and framing add to the mood, making even simple moments feel intense. The CGI, however, is a weak spot. Some effects feel off and take away from the immersion rather than adding to it. Directing is solid, but some scenes could have had more impact with tighter execution.

The lead performance is great, bringing depth and emotion to the role. Supporting actors do well, though some feel underused. The script works but plays it safe, missing chances to dig deeper. The score adds to the eerie vibe without being overbearing. Overall, Bulbbul is worth a watch for its visuals and atmosphere, but it doesn’t fully capitalize on its potential."

Student Of The Year aka SOTY had a pretty good expectations, considering its youngistan theme, makers and star cast of the film, and not to forget the appealing storyline of it. However it had indeed satisfied the expectations, and further more had hit the right chord to their target audience. On the other hand, the movie was compared with many other movies which had similar kind of themes (college campus), but SOTY is an altogether a complete film with different storyline, and thus provides you a totally fresh and entertaining product.

**Story**

It is the story about three friends - Abhimanyu Singh, Rohan Nanda and Shanaya Singhania - and their group of buddies. Rohan Nanda aka Ro (Varun Dhawan) is a rich son of a well-known business tycoon Nanda (Ram Kapoor), and rules the St. Teresa's High School (Dehradun) with his style, attitude and riches. He is quite flirty among other girls, but has a beautiful and gorgeous girlfriend, Shanaya (Alia Bhatt). Also though Ro was a rich son of an entrepreneur, but he had a soft heart for everyone. Shanaya is a rich modern girl, who thinks herself as a fashion designer, and rules the college with her charm, beauty, and sex-appeal. Now the entry of Abhimanyu aka Abhi, he hails from a small town and aspires to become a big person one fine day. Abhi rules the college with his style, attitude and a perfect victory in everything. This irks Ro, and the two often clashes with each other. However because of his soft heart, both of them became friends and then best friends.

The turning point comes when an unexpected love triangle happens between Ro, Abhi and Shanaya, which is further followed by the 'Student Of The Year' competition in St. Teresa's High School. How these three people copes up with their complicated relationship, and eventually who wins the coveted trophy of Student Of The Year, forms the crux of the story.

**Final Verdict**

It's a new age mixture of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander, with a complete different and engaging storyline. On the whole, Karan Johar's 'Student Of The Year' is a perfect film for all the youngistan, a perfect film for entertainment, and a perfect film to watch it again and again. 'Student Of The Year' is the 'Film Of The Year' for the youth gang."

Usually Indian film fans are divided according to the regions. Because if you turn any corner in that country, there's another film industry, another English alphabet replaced to rhyme with Hollywood. They have got their own bunch of actors, filmmakers and films. They might be divided over films and film productions, but they always united when it comes to cricket.

Remember one and a half decade ago an Indian film about the same sport made into the Oscars, but did not win. This film was based on the life of one of the greatest Indian and world cricket player. So length into breadth of the India, it was a highly anticipated sport-biographical film. India has a long history of cricket. It was brought into the country by the British nearly half a millennium ago. It is called a gentlemen's game, which means only rich and royal people can play.

So in India, cricket was always been a game highly influenced in big cities. Players from those places are high in demand till recently. Talents from second and third tier cities never been noticed. But some player made it because of political and other sort of influence. That's changed forever when Mehendra Singh Dhoni's success inspired millions of people. Made youngsters to take bat and ball believing someday they can play for their state or in the national team.

If you are an Indian, I'm sure you had heard many things about him, his difficult path to stardom. There's nothing much difference in the life journeys of his and Shivaji Rao Gaekwad. They both were ticket sellers/collectors. Struggled through to initiate their profession, but in a different field. Now they're superstars.

In Indian films, it's only recently the trend had started in biopics. For a cricketer, it is an ideal initiation. Remember Sachin Tendulkar's documentary film is due to release in this summer, but it is an international project. It can't be neglected because of his hardcore fans, not just in India, but across the world. He had retired a while ago, but still fans chant his name during the recent games.

I know this director, since one of his films was remade as 'Someone Like You'. Bollywood films are always very stylish, but slips away while depicting realism of India, Indian society and culture. That's where I lost interest in them. I watched it for MS, since he plays/played for my team CSK who is known as Thala.

Seems funny, some of the lines that translated into Tamil. But culture wise, it is understandable. A boy was born on the 7th of July '81, but soon the narration shifts focus on his childhood in the late 80s. A fine football goalkeeper, but changed his sport after an unexpected offer. Extremely interested in batting, but his opportunity was being a wicket keeper.

>❝You won't face the same ball always in your life. You've to play on your merit and just hang in there. The scoreboard will keep ticking along.❞

When he enters his teenage, he had learnt to play his own method. Particularly in batting which is the least given privilege to him by his coach. Supportive parents, but from above that, the great friends gang, he had with him at all the good and bad times. The first half is all about the cricket. In fact the whole film was about him and the cricket, the rest of his life was not concentrated enough. I mean on other stuffs, except the romance that takes off during the beginning of the second half. So basically that's where you will come to know this guy is a man with feelings and emotions like you and me.

We all knew him as a cricketer, a great cricketer to say. Since his romance parts come into play, for a brief moment the sport was set aside. A love story kick starts. All those who believed he's a superhuman, will come to realise after witnessing Bollywood style of romance, which is basically how happens in real India. He's not an emotion showing type, especially in public or during the game. But there's a scene in the film and when it appears, that's really heartbreaks. No offense, but it looked Sakshi demanded a proposal than expecting it to come her way naturally.

The three hours is too long for a film, but for this film I felt they had left out many things with short scenes/events, otherwise it would have gone past the four hour mark or even higher. So two part film would have made it a better product, but I'm happy for it to be a single film.

I was bothered about the songs, but they smartly merged them with the storytelling. Particularly commercial films can't afford to lose the blue print of Indian cinema, since songs are the free television commercial, to popularise the film prior to its release. All the actors were great. The lead actor was at his best, especially when it comes to the technics in the games to match the Dhoni's style of play. Most of the locations are the actual locations, including the school, grounds and house(s). I think it was a good move.

The film was not entirely true. They have changed the events to suit the cinematic. A man's 30 years of life journey to put into a 3 hour film, it has to be done and they did it neatly in Indian style. Some people are complaining about this and that, but that's understandable if you understand the concept of filmmaking, particularly money making film.

Only the first two acts were very gripping. The final act was predictable, if you are an ardent cricket follower. Because you know everything on field about this man which is what covered in those parts. And the rest of the film was like behind the scenes of a film called his life. This is a wonder film, and I know the majority of the Indians won't miss it or had already watched it. But for the outsiders, this is not a bad flick, even if you don't know the sport or the player. Worth a try, otherwise definitely recommended.

Distraught, he and his brother ""Lakshman"" determine to rescue her and what now ensues is a wonderfully executed animated adventured packed with myth and legend, mystical monsters, swash and buckle, romance, tragedy, politics - indeed just about everything that you'd expect from an Indian epic (with quite a lot of stunning Japanese creative investment). The style of the drawing is not especially detailed, but it is vivid, colourful and flows perfectly from scenes of isolation and intensity to the grand battle scenarios and a flying chariot (that reminded me a little of the ""Thief of Bagdad"" from 1940). The story itself is the stuff to make Machiavelli blush - intrigues, betrayal and treachery all feature as ""Ram"" has to thwart the evil ambitions of his nemeses - and the powerful ""Ravana"" isn't his only one of these! The score has a slightly classical style to it that works well with rich string arrangements assisting the artwork to do a fair degree of the heavy lifting and helping keep the dialogue from rambling. It's 2¼ hours long, but it flew by in an exciting and enjoyable fashion that illustrated the depth and richness of a culture that has legend a-plenty to enthral and entertain."

Period.**

There are movies that have great plot lines, there are movies that have great actors who make the movie great, there are movies which have great directors. But this is a movie with a great message and one that our Indian society needs to listen, believe and enact upon.

Incidents happen and are forgotten, people speak and they go quiet, mass movements are organized and they fade. But our mindset has not really changed. We still judge a woman's character by the way she dresses, the way she starts to feel comfortable with someone, by the time she steps in and out of home, by her choice of consuming alcohol or not, and the list can grow pretty long.

PINK tries to make that exact same point that any sane society believes in, that we cannot have different set of rules to judge someone's character. One gender cannot be judged by some specific set of rules that do not apply to the other gender. In fact, it isn't even about the gender, judging anyone's character is a crime we all commit when none of us can measure our own selves with the same set of rules in the same scale of balance and come out of it pure and serene.

Now, going towards the movie's review, this movie shouldn't be judged by it's story line, direction, editing, cinematography, or the acting. All of which were commendable in their own way so as to put through the point that the movie was trying to present to the audience precisely. Rather, it should be judged by the fact that our society deeply suffers from this disease of judging a woman's character and act with her in a manner according to the outcome of our judgement as we see fit. The part where Rajveer's character says that everybody present in the courtroom would feel the same way bout girls like these sums up the thought process of a great part of our society.

Amitabh Bachchan's character's expressions in the end personifies the sorry state our country would feel at times like these. When we have to issue a manual about the woman's safety in our society. The points mentioned by Deepak Sehgal that should be there in the manual are cruel but true.

I can go on and on about the greatness and seriousness of the point that the director has tried to put across, but it'd all be for nothing if we'd feel that it was another good movie that made a good point.

We need to change the way we grow up our boys and nurture them with the idea of respecting a woman's modesty and understand the firmness, completeness and absoluteness of the word NO. I wish dearly that I witness this change in our society in this lifetime where movies like PINK are no longer NECESSARY to make us realize that the way we treat women in our somewhat modern society, sometimes, is inhumane.

Going away from the preachy tone of this review I'd like to mention that the acting of all the characters, Amitabh Bachchan, Tapsee Pannu, and the other girls, Kirti and Andrea in fact, especially was just what was required, nothing less nothing more. It was believable and you could feel their helplessness. The direction by Aniruddha Roy Chaudhary was really good.

All in all, for me, this is more than your good , bad, average Bollywood movie. Seemed like a message to be thought and enacted upon, by Shoojit Sircar"

<em>'Jagga Jasoos'</em> has a lot of positives, but there's one big negative that affects everything else - the run time. There is simply no reason for this to be 155 minutes long, there's so much unnecessary faffing about. There's a fantastic spine to the film, but it's just flooded by lameness.

Ranbir Kapoor is entertaining in the lead, he very much commits to the role of Jagga - he's amusing but does have a few moments of heart also. Katrina Kaif (Shruti) and Saswata Chatterjee (Bagchi) support Kapoor extremely well. A few of the others, like Saurabh Shukla, are decent too.

The music is pretty good, the core premise has potential and the cinematography et al. is solid. I'm not completely sold on how the story is told, I mostly liked it but the back and forth nature does annoy in a few parts.

In short, it's worth a watch - but snappier pacing would've raised this film up higher in my ratings."

For me, I somehow felt suitably entertained by <em>'Aladin'</em>.

It's not a great film, at all. However, it's in a similar vein to productions like <em>'The Cat in the Hat'</em> so always divides opinion. If you can find enjoyment, you'll obviously like it but otherwise you'll hate it. I'm under the former.

The cast help a lot. Riteish Deshmukh suits the role of Aladin, while Amitabh Bachchan and Sanjay Dutt are enjoyable as Genius and Jaffar. Despite the title/titular character, it's more so a film that refers to <em>'Aladdin'</em> rather than a remake/reimagining of the famous folk tale. I liked how they set this up, sure it is dumb but it works in my opinion.

I did start getting bored towards the end, so the run time is most definitely too long - 90 minutes, as opposed to 132, would've been ideal. I'd be rating this much lower if not for the likeable cast and the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously; until the end, I guess.

I entirely get if you dislike this, but I didn't... quite the opposite to be honest."

<em>'ABCD 2'</em> is just as slow and limp as the original, though once again does feature a crap tonne of dance so if that's all you want then you might like this. I didn't, simply put. They even made this one slightly longer, which was a very bad call.

This film does have a bit more of an actual plotline to follow, but it isn't anything of substance and quickly takes on all the clichés you'd expect it to. Like the other, it is very poorly written. Be original, if nothing else. As for the cast, Prabhu Deva reprises the role of Vishnu - I found his acting to be a tad better this time. As before, though, no-one else onscreen sticks out.

Most Indian audiences would like this movie a lot but for me it was a case of an average movie that could've been a great one. There were a lot of loop holes(not particularly plot holes) and it could have been cut short by about 10-15 minutes. Some dialogs seemed as if they've been included just to please the audiences like Akshay's wife saying more than once ""Marna mat""(Don't die). In fact she was one of the only miscast of the movie. Started 'not liking' her from her very first scene. First half felt like somewhat dragging, but the second half must've infused interest in the majority.

The movie had its pros too, first of which was the star-cast and the acting. Akshay Kumar was great, which he always is in these kind of roles, and everyone supported hi beautifully, be it the fight sequence from Tapsee Pannu, or the supporting roles of Anupam Kher and Rana Daggubati. Danny Dengzongpa seems to be in the second innings of his career and I'd love for him to play an elongated part in this one. Other good things about this movie were that it seemed good on the technical front and the research behind it bore fruits like the rest of the director's works. Finally, Rasheed Naz must be the perfect person to play 'Maulana Mohammed Rahman'.

I personally liked D-Day, which was based on the similar story-line, a lot better than Baby though the majority might differ. Hence I won't say to stay away from this one, instead go for it and decide for yourself."

It was in the pre-production for over a decade, before reshuffle and recasting happened with the existing one. It was supposed to be an Indo-Aussie joint production, but later the Belgium production company joined the project. After the several hurdles it managed to get completed. It was an Anglo-Indian historical romance-drama, during the British raj in India about betrayal, coup, revenge and a journey movie. Also simultaneously set in the modern world focusing an archaeological couple who discovers a lost ancient Indian jewel in a shipwreck. From there the story gets a perfect beginning, later moves back to India.

I don't understand what's with the Chinese music where the actual story take place in the 18th century India. It was so good and blends well, but that does define India or Indian culture while narrating its story. If you are not familiar with both Chinese and Indian musics, then it's not an issue at all. But that does not it, the names are Hindu and Indian soldiers with the Persian costumes, swords and other gadgets.

How the name 'Dragon's Throat' came to Indian geographical area and surname for the Indian characters in a wrong princely state. Like that, many stuffs make no sense, especially if you are from that part of the Earth. I think the research was very poor for making this movie. They should have hired an Indian musician and costume designer with an historian.

> ""Love has many faces,
> and one of them is jealousy.""

The quality was top notch, the cast and their performances were excellent. But I could not stand for Bipasha Basu's facial expressions. She was always been in a sad face look, so depressing. That is the way her character was developed, so nothing wrong in her display. It was her international debut flick as well, and the launch was so disappointing. Because the story was very weak, maybe very silly. I have never seen the narration set in the ancient India other than in the Indian films. Quite amazing locations, and convinced with the visuals that how the 1700s' subcontinent would have looked like.

The major problem with this flick is that people can't get ending. How the time barrier was broken to pass through another timeline was never explained. The Hindu priest/saint/sadhu who blabbers about the space and time was a ridiculous than intellectual briefing. So this film owes lots of explanation to the viewers than entertaining them. I want to favour it, but I also want to be honest. The film was not like I was hoping for, very excited for the merge of historical subject with sci-fi, but did not stand tall. Thankfully, either it was not a bad movie of the year, I've seen even worse that I felt not to review. I won't recommend it, but there's a slim chance that you might like it, so choose it carefully.

Such is his magical charisma in the film (and in almost all) that I can't resist but start this review of Vasan Bala's second feature, Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota (The Man Who Feels No Pain) by singing his praises despite it being a masterful work of superb cast performances (including the lead Abhimannyu Dassani and Radhika Madan). He comes second in the silly yet full-of-life plot that narrates the story of Surya (Dassani), a young man born with a life-threatning rare disease which prevents him from feeling any pain, who yearns to push evil off the face of at least his small world. Helping him in his venture are the characters that I am in love with. In addition to Devaiah, Mahesh Manjrekar is the man who helps in making the film more memorable as you end the film humming that one number from the indie, upbeat soundtrack that has stayed with you and reminded you of a time when fun was simply watching a video of your favourite kung-fu hero in a VHS tape at your wealthy friend's house. Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota is brilliantly crafted by Bala with some of the best action choreography and music mixing I have seen all year this year. The humour is local, original, and bang-on ROFL material. If you are okay with shedding all threads of realism and watching a film for what it is (ultimate silliness) you will love this action comedy film more than I did. It is made for the generation of cinema consumers who would get it more if I use a certain term, so I will: it's on fleek. TN.

U will love the 'Mike Tyson' of UP !!**


The title Anurag Kashyap's latest refers to the central character, aspiring boxer Shravan (Vineet Kumar Singh).This film, which is loosely based on a true story, focuses on the cross-caste romance between Shravan and Sunaina (Zoya Hussain), the feisty, mute niece of gangster boxing promoter Bhagwan Das (Jimmy Shergill, struggling with decidedly uncomfortable-looking contact lenses). Like Kashyap’s impressive gangster epic The Gangs of Wasseypur, this is gritty, grubby film-making. The dialogue is robustly filthy, the violence unflinching and the music loaded with innuendo. And while the fight sequences lack polish, the plot points are pounded home with fists, feet and iron bars.


Shravan (Vineet Kumar Singh) is the true hero of this film. His is a tremendous performance, not least because of his staggeringly authentic physicality. Singh looks the part, from the way his t-shirt sleeve cuts into his biceps like tightly tied twine to the agility with which he skips in the ring, and his arduous workouts immediately put glossier Hindi film heroes in their place. He makes Shravan real, when he's throwing punches as well as when he's vulnerable.


Ravi Kishan blew me away with his role as a sincere Dalit coach, one who grew up idolising Pele, wasn't allowed to box, but is an athlete and sits bolt upright, even when being insulted.


Now about the film's villain, Bhagwan - the coach named God - but Jimmy Shergill, bloodshot eyes and menacing rage, is incredible. Scary good, as they say. Why he is scary is something you should discover.


Though in spite of a lengthy run time,Kashyap’s films have an unpredictable energy that can be genuinely thrilling to watch. This is certainly true of this politics-infused sports melodrama. Each and every character has given a marvelous performance, And specially Shravan, You can feel him into the character.


_Overall, It is Kashyap's one of the greatest movie, it has all sought of flavors which will keep u intact and admired from time to time. A worthy film and a true entertainer_"

For the eyes, mind and heart, there is nothing more beautiful, more soothing and more soul stirring than the color Saffron.

Just the glimpses of saffron color instantly pump that courage, valor, bravery and Divinity within. The saffron plays a very important part in our lives. We live for it, we defend it and we sacrifice for it.

Kesari: The Saragarhi battle is one of the most remarkable and powerful chapters in the history of Bharat under British rule; which knowingly and royally ignored to communicate to the people of Bharat and for the obvious reason, yes you guessed it right.

The Saragarhi battle was fought between 21 Sikhs and 10,000 Afghans at Saragarhi fort and this full blown battle lasted until the sunset and while defending their fort; the brave 21 Sikhs fought tooth and nail till their last breathe, but made sure a good number of Afghan-Jihads were buried in the debris of their own, in unrecognizable conditions.

Akshay Kumar, is walking on a different planet these days, when all his contemporaries are falling one after the other by doing the routine, mundane films; he rediscovers himself for every 4th month and charts into different terrain only to scale the victorious peaks. This is his career best performance and for a change he gleefully glides into a slim Sikh role (could notice while doing a boomerang-bending kind stunts while attacking Jihadis with his visibly saffron-hot sword). All the other performances were on DOT.

The story takes its time to build in the first half with necessary Sikh-comedy, typical Bollywood secularism, but it’s the second hour where the full blown action occupies all the frames. The cinematography is top notch and cynosure to the eyes, music is equally and emotionally-effective; while the BGM provokes the audience while setting up the war frames.

The air within Bollywood is blowing in a different direction as these days the films are being made on the right concept and true heroes which is a welcome change. The Nationalists are lapping up such films wholeheartedly."

<em>'The Tashkent Files'</em> isn't a typical Hindi film, at least compared to the ones I've watched thus far. It takes its time with the story and properly sifts through it, without any songs shoehorned in. I thoroughly felt entertained by it, despite a potentially damaging 144 minute run time.

There are some very good performances from the cast. Shweta Basu Prasad is no doubt the star, she puts a lot of emotion into the role of Raagini. Mithun Chakraborty is extremely likeable as Shyam, he keeps the film moving when the focus comes away from Prasad. Naseeruddin Shah is the most noteworthy of the rest, who are all pleasant to watch.

I had no knowledge of Lal Bahadur Shastri before this, so it was very interesting to learn bits and pieces about this period of India's history - even if it features disputed elements and the usual creative license that films use. I think they tell it very well, with/without the aforementioned.

I watched this on the UK's Zee Cinema channel, who broadcasted a version with a crap tonne of censorship over names, countries, organisations etc. It actually turned into an amusing little game to try and guess what was behind the blur!

Aamir Raza Husain and Ratna Pathak Shah are terrific in those aforementioned roles, there's so many possibilities with them. Instead, the film decides to head into the silly comedy realm instead of making use of a possibly strong narrative to create a very hearty production.

With that said, for what does happen it isn't terrible. As noted I couldn't enjoy it enough, but Sonam K Ahuja (Mili) and Fawad Khan (Vikram) do alright. There are few good scenes between them, but it's mostly forgettable unfortunately. The music is decent, ""Naina"" does stick out.

I can't say I'd recommend this, though you could do much worse I guess. I just would've loved a deeper story, especially with some pieces already in place for it to be so."

That is the exact problem I had with Nitesh Tiwari's Chhichhore (2019) last year  (but it was a smaller sin then) which co-incidentally uses the same typeface as this in its posters. Chhalaang aims to be about grit and determination and romance but the lead character's bumptiousness prevents me from taking him and the film seriously. It annoys you a little when the man (Rajkummar), a slacking fitness coach at a small rural school, is forced to pull up his socks at the sight of a nemesis coach assigned by the principal. And yet his traits don't change and I don't see any motivational element in it.

It also goes on for too long, my version of the film - via Colors Cineplex - only ran for around two hours... I'm not sure where the apparent extra thirty or so minutes went, though I'm kinda glad as that extra portion would probably put my rating much lower. At least the music is nice.

She decides to hire a private investigator to find the truth. She goes to Kishan, both successful, cunning and easily trusted. He soon finds that when Yogi is about to be discovered by his wife, both his friends come to the rescue, which targets them for investigation. Soon he understands that the three cheat on their wives. Saddened by Sanjana's deep grief, he decides to teach them a lesson.

Anees Basmee is very well known for his Bollywood comedies, very often about marital problems, in the French tradition of French theater author Vaudeville (his name was used for the genre later). I usually only mildly like his movies, but this one is more cunning in making the cheating husbands ridiculous and guilty. The first part is more of Kishand trying to find proof of the guilt of the three, then it's more revenge of the wives for their husband's disloyalty.

What's great in this one is that the wives are really more than angry shrews, they are really affected by the deception, and have their own reactions. The cast is doing a phenomenal job, Akshay as the cunning guy that gets moved by these cheated wives, the three friends trying to save the appearances by using stupid lies that put them in miserable situations, and the wives having very realistic emotions for the situation.
Yes, even ""playgirl"" Rimi Sen (never forgotten for her sexy role in Dhoom 1) is really great at acting her part. Stunning Celina is the sad friend that can get wild when necessary, and Sonam is the shy gentle girl that gets devastated by what happens.
Very enjoyable movie."

""Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya"" offers a desi twist to the romantic comedy genre with a sci-fi touch, distinguishing itself from Hollywood counterparts. While the AI concept brings a whacky idea, the film falters due to mediocre writing, lacking a solid payoff or satisfactory ending. Shahid Kapoor's relaxed charm and magical dance sequences elevate the film, though the direction falls short. Kriti Sanon shines, balancing AI objectivity and warmth in an illogical yet entertaining love story. The noteworthy music, especially ""Akhiyaan Gulaab"" and ""Tum Se,"" earns a place in playlists. Despite lacking top-tier humor, the film serves as a harmless rom-com for Valentine's, particularly for the hopeless romantics.


Full Review :

**Screenplay:**
""Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya"" unfolds with a breezy and harmless romantic comedy screenplay, introducing a unique desi twist to the sci-fi genre. The film maintains a light-hearted tone throughout, preventing the audience from taking it too seriously. However, the AI concept, while whacky, suffers from mediocre writing, leading to occasional drags and an ultimately unsatisfactory ending. The family dynamics portrayed are average, lacking the depth seen in recent dramas. The screenplay struggles to provide a solid payoff, leaving the audience wanting more substance and resolution.

**Performances:**
Shahid Kapoor shines with charm and delivers magical dance sequences, showcasing a relaxed side post his intense roles. Despite the half-baked direction, his performance stands out, adding an enjoyable vibe to the film. Kriti Sanon steals the show, skillfully balancing AI objectivity and warmth in this illogical yet entertaining love story. Her portrayal demonstrates restraint and class, preventing the character from descending into slapstick territory. Supporting roles, particularly Shahid and Kriti's, contribute to the film's overall appeal, but the potential of the cast is hindered by the screenplay's limitations.

**Music:**
The film boasts noteworthy music that becomes a highlight. Tracks like ""Akhiyaan Gulaab"" and ""Tum Se"" set the tone with their vibrant beats, making them standouts. The sensational Varun Jain's humming in ""Tum Se"" and the full-vibe ""Akhiyaan Gulaab"" by Mitraaz add a delightful touch to the soundtrack. ""Laal Peeli Akhiyaan"" carries the right beats for a party cracker. The score, overall, is beautifully composed, earning a spot in the audience's playlists. The musical elements enhance the film's entertainment value, providing a treat for the ears and contributing significantly to its overall charm.

<em>'102 Not Out'</em> is a film that I had a pleasant time with. Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor are terrific in this release, with those two making for an entertaining double act. Jimit Trivedi and Vijay Raaz are solid too, albeit in much more minor roles.

I wouldn't say anything comedically made me laugh, though the humour is still one of the film's main positives. It, in fact, holds its own when it comes to the more sombre bits, which are put together almost perfectly. I thought it would stray into cringe/cheese territory at some point, but this flick never does... it actually comes across impressively well.

The music is also pretty good, I particularly enjoyed ""Bachche Ki Jaan"" - even though it does sound out of place here and there, yet again finds a way to work. ""Badumbaaa"" makes for a decent outro piece, shame about the (minor, in how often its seen - editor had a conscience?) use of blackface for the music video though - not that it was ever fine, but in 2018? Come on...

Overall, this did indeed surprise me. Hearty."

Karthi does an impressive job as the glorified hero Theeran and most of the film is carried by his character. Although at times the heroism is a bit too stretched that one may think that it would have been better if the sole focus of the narrative wasn't through the single character.

""Theeran Adhigaram Ondru"" is a solid crime thriller which compromises a little for commercialization yet manages to be an impressive account of a brutal true story. As the title refers the film as Adhigaaram Ondru meaning Chapter One, there are chances of a sequel. But the Operation Bawariya story is finished here and since the character is fictional they can go on with a fictional story. Although, let us hope that it won't turn out like the atrocious ""Singam"" trilogy starring Surya, elder brother of Karthi.

My Rating : ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (86/100)

Hi Nanna is a poignant journey of a single father which is heartfelt and feel good in its entirety. Director Shouryuv 's debut film and he has done a marvelous job in telling a well written story. The most beautiful part of the film is it's rich music, scored by Hesham Abdul Wahab. His work definitely enhanced the emotional journey. The screenplay is well done, but many unnecessary scenes seemed forced, just like that idiotic Shruti Hasan song but Nani holds the fort which a charming and magnetic performance and the raw emotions make it a difficult film to dislike. 

Nani is truly admirable because his choices of film needs a lot of praise. He is commendable, be it scenes of him being excited in love or being practical about his situation he shines in all the frames he comes in. The little kid Kiara Khanna cuteness and her innocence is what the film scores high on too. She is just adorable throughout. Mrunal has done a commendable job as for someone who doesn't know the language, her lip sync with the Telugu artist is extremely believable. Priyadarshi and Jayaram fantastic supporting performances.

Overall, Hi Nanna is no masterpiece nor a film with minimal flaws, but what it strives to achieve is entertain the audience with a wholesome emotional story and it's does that quite well. Urge you to watch this, if dramatic family movies with romance is your liking. I was pleasantly surprised.

X and Instagram : @streamgenx

Hi Nanna is such a heartwarming watch. Holds your attention from the first frame and surprises you with the twists & turns through the narrative. Has the heart at its right place, evokes laughter, makes you emotional and finally leaves you on a happy note.

Nani, Mrunal Thakur and Baby Kiara Khanna deliver a formidable performance, that stays with you. It's a love story that will live with the audience for years to come.

It's a MUST watch!"

It's a simple story of a group of friends from Nagaland and other parts of Northeast India living as paying guests in Delhi. They are trying to prepare the dish for their friend on her special occasion, which is hindered by a variety of issues, ranging from catcalling to discrimination. It does get uncomfortable at times and that is the essence of watching Axone; it hits you because what it shows you is true.

tt2339505,Kochadaiiyaan,2014,"Action, Adventure, Animation","Rajinikanth, Deepika Padukone, R. Sarathkumar, Shobana, Aadhi Pinisetty","A noble warrior seeks revenge against the ruler of his kingdom, who killed his father. At the same time, he also ends up upsetting the neighbouring enemy kingdom's ruler.",5.4,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/imvahgJM2w1LQnSnZEgaycRbgx.jpg,"Kochadaiiyaan opens with a prologue that tells us that the two kingdoms, Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri, have been at war with one another for generations. We see a boy from Kottaipattinam, who is about to drown, being rescued and the boy, Rana, grows up to become a soldier in Kalingapuri. He earns the friendship of the prince Veera Mahendran, and is made the general of its army. He seeks the king's permission to attack their enemy nation but on the battlefield, Rana reveals himself to be the son of Kochadaiiyaan, the famed general of Kottaipattinam and admits that he enacted a drama to rescue the soldiers of his motherland, who were being held as slave labourers there. Rana is received with joy by his king and even gets him to marry the prince to his sister, but he also has an ulterior motive — to kill the king, who had unfairly sentenced his father to death.

Kochadaiiyaan succeeds not because of technology but because of the writing. The film is motion capture 3D computer-animated but the animation is primeval; both the motion capture and the texture of the visuals are closer to The Polar Express than Avatar or Tintin. The long shots aren't problematic but whenever the camera cuts to a close-up, we are drawn to the inanimate nature of the expressions. The characters feel like caricatures of the real-life actors we have known. The movements of the actors, too, are robotic (in dance numbers, it feels like the characters are doing yoga), and the detailing is far from perfect, especially for characters in the background.

There is also inconsistency in the animation. Some of the scenes seem to have sheen while in some the perspective fluctuates; there are times when a boulder looks as big as the man standing on it and blades of grass look like miniature paddy plants. But the sweeping camera work, the proficient voice over work by the actors, and the energetic background score compensate for these blemishes.

Once the plot kicks into gear, the animation takes a backseat and the narration starts to hold our attention. The songs and the stunts are woven into the story and do not stick out. Like any other Rajini movie, Kochadaiiyaan, too, worships its star. His character appears in almost every scene and there are fan-pleasing moments in the form of stylistic gestures and dialogues.

The story initially seems like a typical simplistic revenge fantasy (a son avenging his father's death) but as the plot progresses, we realize it is a bit more complex than that. The film actually ends by leaving its lead character in a moral dilemma. His family has served the king and protected him for generations but now, the son has acted otherwise. What fate does his action beget him? What happened to Rana's elder brother who has vanished mysteriously? Where is his friend who abdicated the throne to marry the girl he loved and chose to leave his kingdom? Will the enemy prince that Rana let live return? With such interesting questions, Soundarya has set up the knot for a deserving sequel."

It's a solid debut.

<em>'Do Dooni Chaar'</em> features a fairly amusing, hearty and largely enjoyable premise. It's pretty much a social commentary on teaching and life on a budget. I don't think it nails the mix of seriousness and fun incredibly, but there's no doubt it still connects on a good level.

Rishi Kapoor is suitably entertaining in the lead role of Santosh, he is easily the star of this film. His real life wife Neetu Singh (Kusum), Aditi Vasudev (Payal) and Archit Krishna (Sandy) play his family members well. It's a decent cast.

The ending is a little questionable in its execution, though I get what they were attempting to do with it. The pacing isn't perfect either. Still, thanks to its message and heart, it's a production I had a positive time watching. Mid range Disney."

The problem is not the fact that it is a slapstick comedy, but the fact that there’s little or no semblance of a coherent narrative. From the very first scene, the film is armed with loud action and dialogues trying to be funny, but far from that. And there are a lot of characters, one sillier than the other. While Anil Kapoor once again plays the flashy gangster with his trademark loudness, Arshad Warsi is the funny guy with witty one-liners. John Abraham exudes charm despite his goofy character and Pulkit Samrat once again plays up on his boyish charm. But the three heroines are reduced to looking pretty and mouthing silly lines such as, “Papa kehte hain kiss karne se main pregnant ho jaungi.” Among the character artistes, Saurabh Shukla is impressive as the bumbling mobster who is more funny than scary. There is also a character named Niraj Modi (Inaamulhaq) evidently fashioned on the fugitive businessman Nirav Modi. With an unconvincing Gujarati accent, his character comes off as yet another stereotypical cliche.

Director Anees Bazmee, along with his co-writers, throw in everything into the mix. From exciting car chases to high-octane destruction scenes, from African lions to an entire act involving industrial strength glue – all shot beautifully in the picturesque UK. But nothing sticks, thanks to a weak script. There are far too many songs placed randomly that only add to the run-time. Towards the end, it even meanders into a patriotic subplot that seems more forced.

Even with an enviable star-cast and heavy-duty action, Pagalpanti never really manages to pull off more than a few laughs."

Sure enough, sites list this as either drama or docu-drama or docu-fiction or if you believe Google, it's drama/short. It's neither.

It has real-life characters playing a fictionalised act, and fictional characters chasing the ghosts of slain real-life people. The legend or the ghosts these characters are after are very larger than life and this has an impact on the film we watch as it gets into a very surreal territory at most times, blending what is real and unreal... And as if it was predestined to, the film eventually mutates itself into a ghost story of its own. And this is just a tiny bit of many experiments this film has.

This film is among Shyam Benegal's best work. Benegal assembles some highly professional actors, with Shabana Azmi excelling as the crude, selfish, yet likable ""Bai"" (madam) of the ""Khota"" (brothel), Smita Patil as the beautiful, gentle-looking, but rebellious Zeenat. The movie rests on their strong performances, and also on Naseeruddin Shah's, whose character reveals a lot about the 'khota' and about the relationships between its inhabitants. The relationship between Rukminibai and Tungrus is deceptively simple, for underneath all their interactions there is a deep concern they share for each other. This is why we see Tungrus being excessively critical of her during the opening scenes; he worries for her.

The relationship between Rukminibai and Zeenat is one of the main focuses of this movie; Rukminibai loves Zeenat like a daughter, but feels threatened when Zeenat wants to assert her freedom, and becomes addicted to 'taking care' of Zeenat and keeping her under her control. She eventually alienates herself from all the women who work for her, and her seemingly strong personality disintegrates, and right when she is on the verge of breaking down, and when the possibility of starting afresh and maybe beginning a reflective process of self-recovery appears, she tragically falls into the cycle of selfish-love/'motherly' control again.

Other interesting facets of this movie include the 'social worker', Shanti Devi, who is concerned about the moral degradation of the city, and fights the unrelenting prostitutes to claim back lost honor. There is an especially emotionally frustrating scene where Shanti Devi speaks about how a woman should be respected and not sold, while addressing a crowd, and proclaims that she will persuade her 'sisters' to give up this lowly work. Some prostitutes respond with, ""And where will we get our bread?"" Shanti Devi, the great, compassionate womens-rights espouser coldly says, ""Bread isn't everything in life."" One of the women casually reply with bursting frustration: ""you must get it for free."" 

The prostitutes' fate feebly dangles in between these powerful forces--on the one side, there is the moral, 'feminist', social-worker, who is so superficially attached to her 'cause' that she cannot relate to real women and their struggles, and on the other, there is the powerful industrialist, Gupta, who buys their brothel with the intention of razing it down, but continues to mislead them.

Other female representations include Gupta's extremely-inhibited, mentally-restrained, child-like daughter, for whom he strategically arranges a marriage with the son of another powerful figure who also ties-in with the prostitutes in another manner. Aditya Bhattacharya plays the innocent, young Sushil, engaged to Gupta's daughter, but attracted to the liveliness and beauty he perceives in the unpretentious Zeenat. His attraction to her soon proves to be problematic, however.

This movie very subtly points out how morally-lacking these surrounding forces are, and how the prostitutes, who seem more real and bound by morals than the other, rather snobbish, 'respectable' people, ultimately are forced to take the blame for 'moral degradation' and are forced to leave the city (their struggles don't end there). This theme is at the heart of the recurring song (Rukminibai hums it often, and also asks Zeenat to sing it), ""Zabaane Badalte Hain Har Aan Khubaan.. Yeh Sab Kuch Hai Bigdi Zamaane Ki Baatein."""

My experience watching it was a rollercoaster of intense action and emotional moments, though the film ultimately felt uneven.

The cinematography and action sequences are visually impressive, showcasing well-choreographed stunts that kept me engaged. Siddhant's portrayal of Yudhra is commendable; he effectively embodies the character's rage and vulnerability. However, despite the strong performances, particularly from Malavika Mohanan, their on-screen chemistry felt lacking, which diminished some emotional stakes.

While the first half builds anticipation with intriguing setups, the second half loses momentum and falls into predictability. The story meanders, and I found myself wishing for a more cohesive narrative that could tie the action to deeper emotional arcs. The film's relentless violence may appeal to action enthusiasts, but it often overshadows character development.

Overall, Yudhra offers thrilling moments and a glimpse of potential but ultimately feels like a missed opportunity to deliver a more impactful story. It’s worth watching for action fans, but those seeking a strong narrative may be left wanting more.

These Cargos are people who have just died on Earth and we learn that Prahastha works for Post Death Transition Services — a large, pioneering, bureaucratic company that stores, transitions, and recycles dead people for rebirth.

It starts off with an aspiration to be a sci-fi drama about loneliness in the space where the protagonist (Vikrant Massey), a staff at an imaginary post-death transition services agency, has been spending decades and working solo in a breathing spacecraft named Pushkar-something without much contact with the outer world. Then it aims higher and brings in another character (Shweta Tripathi) and scrambles to turn itself into an emotional story about companionship and how ignorance is not always bliss. Without enough background to the story, the plot (where dead people are sent to this transition agency and then sent back home as a new person in optionally some other form) - which is quite zany, to be fair to writer-director Arati Kadav - does not explain things that are essential for its upkeep and interest and just fumbles every now and then until one of the three main characters utters a few words of philosophy and/or existentialism while sipping cola from a Styrofoam cup. I understand the restrictions low budget can put on the production but watching Cargo reminded me of those substandard comedy skits that they play on Indian national television during primetime with canned laughter in the form of a human being as its main character. Even the spacesuits look like they were made out of bed sheets. That skilled actors like Massey and Tripathi are not utilized well shows the additional lack of efforts put in the writing and the direction. Nothing gels in the avant-garde hopeful that this film turns out to be but falls extremely short of every single ingredient except for maybe the score. Watch the HBO drama Six Feet Under (2001) and space stuff Gravity (2013) again and forget that Cargo even existed and that Vikramaditya Motwane or Anurag Kashyap helped produce this technical drivel for laymen.

tt0085138,Adi Shankaracharya,1983,"Drama, History","Sarvadaman D. Banerjee, Srinivasa Prabhu, T. S. Nagabharana, Bharat Bhushan, Manjunath Bhat",The first and only Indian movie to be made in Sanskrit. The movie follows the life and times of Sankara - the founder of the non-duality (Advaita) school of Indian philosophy.,6.4,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/6xvcmYusXqfP01WyJcxhP4NCMwZ.jpg,"It wasn't easy finding this 1983 Indian film, first ever made in Sanskrit language, directed by G. V. Iyer. I heard that it was possible to see it on YouTube, but there is no access to YouTube from China where I am currently working. Anyway, it is over 30 years old movie which looks much older - especially at the start, rolling credits which primary school students could do better in 1983. But, as soon as the movie started you will notice the talent of the team, especially the directing and cinematography (Madhu Ambat) were outstanding! There was a problem with some of the illustrations which were too amateurish, and acting was well overdone... but it won't take too much of the film's beauty.

The film depicts the life and times of 8th century Hindu philosopher, Adi Shankara, who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta (Non-dualism) in Hindu philosophy. At the 31st National Film Awards, it won four awards, including Best Film, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography and Best Audiography. This is a movie which will mainly inform you, and teach you... not set up to entertain you for a minute from its 136 minutes of the official length (I have to say that my version was 158 minutes and I have no idea what cut was that, but it was amazing). Step by step you will understand the way this great teacher thought, the way he developed from a tiny boy to a greatest guru of the Hindu philosophy... the way he accepted life and understood the way it is lived and how it should be lived. You do not have to agree with this teaching to like the narrative style of story telling with lots of chanting and melodic rhythmic reciting of the ancient Vedic texts...

If you love philosophy and movies, perfect choice for you!"

tt4949324,Mohalla Assi,2018,Drama,"Sunny Deol, Ravi Kishan, Sakshi Tanwar, Saurabh Shukla, Mukesh Tiwari",An idealist Sanskrit teacher deals with issues like commercialization of religion as things around him change and he struggles to keep up. But is he ready to pay the price?,7.0,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/bGSbaG6AIIaACEMprEsf2xiLgyO.jpg,"Director Chandraprakash Dwivedi beautifully recreates the Mohalla Assi in this religious/political satire based the novel Kashi Ka Assi. The neighborhood of Assi itself is the protagonist of this movie. The identity of Assi is not just defined by the fact that it is ghat along the holy river, rather it is the also the people who live in that locality. People participate in daily ""parliamentary discussions"" on the changing society and importance of culture at the only place in Varanasi that has democracy, Pappu's tea shop. The characters in the tea shop look straight out of a satire novel in Hindi. The conversations at this shop tie the whole script together and take the story forward. What makes it worth watching is the context that is set around it. It also tries to depict the impact that major religion- based political events had on the people of the society. The humor is very intelligent and contextual, since it is a satire.

The story of the movie was a simple one, where a diligent and honest priest struggles to make ends meet, whereas other half baked gurus dupe the tourists to mint money and lead a comfortable life. It shows how westerners come to the city in search of spirituality and have no clue about what they want. How the city in its own corrupt ways connives to thug them, thereby destroying the moral fabric of it's culture one bit at a time. Ravi Kishan and other supporting characters deliver a wonderful performance as the whole locality revolves around these tourists.

Sunny Deol as the righteous priest beautifully projects the perplexities that the character goes through as he comes to term with the practical challenges of life. However, it is Sakshi Tanwar, as his wife, who really delivers a stand out performance, questioning his eccentricities and still standing by him as a pillar of support. Together they go through their struggles, to find a way to live with their values in this world.

It starts off in 1960 when Govind who's going to Mumbai to try out his luck as a musician bumps into Urvashi, an already established heroin in the film industry. The 2012 one comes in next; there's another bump and that is followed by the 1910 story; another bump of course. At the end of each the lovers are temporarily distanced from each other and towards the end of the movie the 3 stories run parallel to each other as everyone meets everyone and love ensues. Simple. But then again there's nothing much we can do about the endings. They have to meet. What we can do is make the journey interesting, which is where the movie does just about okay. I found the 1960 story the best. It had almost everything in place but the other two weren't up to the mark. If one had good dialogues it didn't have good music; if one had good music it had a boring storyline. And most definitely both had bad screenplays. Shahid Kapur looks handsome and gives an earnest performance in all 3 characters and its because of him that I want the movie to succeed.Priyanka Chopra looks really hot but again hams when she has to play the romantic parts. I hate her for that. Kunal Kohli you could have tried a little harder.

It's very much dance routine first, film second. They really do disregard any attempt at a proper premise, instead putting full focus on dance. In fairness, that's all the majority who choose to watch this will likely want. Still, they could've tried harder with the plot; which hits almost every cliché/trope imaginable.

This might've made for a fun/silly 90 minute production, but at 136 minutes it's a very long watch - it proper dragged, for me anyway. I was OK with events until the ending, which is awful from a story point of view. That's unfortunate, as it is actually set up well with a hearty event - the performance for which is nice, but it quickly loses any momentum that it created from it.

Prabhu Deva (Vishnu), while likeable, isn't lead-worthy in my opinion - he doesn't bring anything memorable or noteworthy to the role. Ganesh Acharya is alright to watch, he brings the amusement as Gopi. None of the dancers stand out, away from their dancing anyway.

The movie that the film-unit is shooting is titled as Aakhri Khoon (the last murder).

The treatment of the murder-based plot is impressive and at place, quite spine-chilling for the viewer. The movie is slow in the beginning but once the first murder takes place, it picks up speed and proves to be thoroughly engrossing for the spectator.

Technically, the movie is not superior. The film and the colours used in shooting and developing the shot stuff seem to be of not-so-good quality because the colours have faded in the print available now. Production value is not high. Editing is OK.

Performances are good. Almost all the artistes have done well. Seasoned actors like Shabana Aazmi, Amol Palekar, Nasiruddin Shah etc. have rocked the screen with their admirable performances. Supporting ones viz. Soni Raazdaan, Sushma Seth, Ajit Vachchhani, Sadashiv Amrapurkar, Nony Ganguly,Virendra Saxena, Deepak Qazir, Avtar Gill, Sudhir Mishra (who later became film director) etc. are all perfectly fit in their respective roles.

Madhavan, Ritika Singh, Mumtaz Sorcar, Nassar, Radha Ravi","A grumpy boxing coach takes on a young, rebellious woman under his wings and starts training her for the world championship. But their biggest battle has to be fought outside the ring.",7.4,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/1aet6kjwoDwNWnwZ8Wtq08cH6QY.jpg,"It is inevitable that a sports film will hew to a certain formula — the discovery of an extraordinary talent, the practice montage, the challenges on and off the field, the grand finale with an outcome that could either be rousing or downbeat. So, it is not surprising that the outlines of Irudhi Suttru, a boxing drama, are familiar. We have a grumpy coach, a rebellious student, politics from the sport's administrators, jealousy from rivals and a tense climactic bout. But what makes the film stand out is how superbly the director, Sudha Kongara uses these plot points to paint her canvas.

The film begins with Prabhu (Madhavan), a once-promising boxer failed by the system and now a no-nonsense coach, being forced to move to Chennai due to internal politics in the boxing association. In Chennai, Prabhu comes across Madhi (Ritika Singh), a rowdy fisherwoman who has a natural flair for boxing, and whose sister, Lakshmi (Mumtaz Sorcar) is training for the boxing championship. Prabhu offers to teach the hot-headed Madhi, who is enthusiastic about the sport but is put off by the coach's stern attitude. The two warm up to each other and Madhi even develops a crush on Prabhu. But there are forces that threaten to derail both their dreams.

The writing is strong for the most parts of Irudhi Suttru and the excellent cast effortlessly conveys the various shades of their characters. The beefed-up Madhavan might be the film's anchor but it is the pocket-sized dynamo Ritika's performance that gives it its punch. The supporting cast is superb. We know what Nasser and Radha Ravi are capable of, but Kaali Venkat, as the girls' drunkard father who converts to Christianity just to make a few bucks, manages to overtake these veterans with his finely-calibrated performance. If there is a chink in the armour, it is the characterisation of the antagonist, Dev, who is one-note and cliched. And the (type)casting of Zakir Hussain for this role doesn't help either.

The little touches, like the observation on Chennai's poster culture (one of the posters welcoming Prabhu calls him 'Boxing Loin'!), the fact that Madhi's mother is a north Indian, that Madhi is a fan of Dhanush, the relationship between Radha Ravi and Madhavan, the explanation Lakshmi gets for why Prabhu prefers Madhi, add a bit of quirkiness to the tale. The fight scenes are also tensely choreographed and are plausible unlike the over-the-top boxing scenes that we saw recently in Bhooloham. But it is the relationship between Prabhu and Madhi is what drives the film and the director makes it amply clear that she needs him as much as he needs her. Their scenes have a charge that keeps us hooked and it is only when Prabhu disappears for a brief while in the second half that we understand how crucial their scenes together are for the film. On the whole, it might not deliver a knockout punch, but Irudhi Suttru manages to land punches that constantly surprise us (the rousing climax ensures that we walk out with a smile) and in a good way.

> One can only show their passion for something, it's the others who are able to see their talent.

Inspired by the boxing culture of the north Chennai. It tells how Indians took the sport in their hand and mastered it, specially this film focused on the women boxing. It is definitely a confident boosting film if you are an ambitious sportsperson. But looks like its for adults due to too much use of the rude language. That really did surprise me, because it is expected for a Bollywood film, but Kollywood has a different culture and it was very strong.

It was not actually about Madhavan, he was just a coach like sharookan from 'Chak de India'. So it is about a young girl named Madhi, who hailed from a poor fisher family. Without any education and social manners, how she makes her fortune turnaround after a new chief boxing coach finds her passion and skill towards the sport. The remaining narration is all about her journey from the slum to the boxing championship.

It kind of reminded me the story of a flower girl from the streets who makes to the high society in the film 'My Fair Lady'. Except here, it was replaced by the boxing. With a bit of romance, music/musical, humours, as well as rivalries and corruption this film is a quite entertaining. Well directed film, but I'm slightly not happy with the screenplay. Because, no doubt, it is a fine theme yet too much localised for domestic market. As a result, if you're an International audience, there's an issue to understand the culture and language translation the loses its originality in the subtitle.

And one more thing is that the background score was good, but disappointing songs, though its video was decent. Awesome performances, especially by Ritika Singh, and Madhavan. The tale was told from his perspective, but Ritika takes the lead with her skillful show in the both, acting and boxing. For the Indians it is surely a must see and one of the best sports films in the recent time, but for the rest of the world, it falls into a decent category.

It has absolutely no songs, it doesn't have any subplots or attempts at comedy, it takes place mostly in one house during one night, and so it is only one hour and 45 minute long, an exception for Hindi films of that time. This helps to create a consistently gripping, interesting and focused picture, which gives the viewer an opportunity to concentrate on the proceedings without breaks. The script is well-written and taut, and Chopra's direction is very good. His attention to detail is quite impressive throughout (although there's a slight lack of it at times), and the film is enjoyably tense, chilling and suspenseful.

The film totally belongs to Nanda who is excellent as the ambiguous and highly appealing Rekha. Whether she is a lonely wife, a terrified captive, or a seductress, she is throughly convincing, but not less important, she is so smashing hot. I don't remember any leading lady of those times looking so effortlessly sensual. She wears only one saree throughout the film (which is also quite unusual), and yet she looks more and more attractive and alluring with each new scene, without ever being vulgar. Towards the end, when the truth is uncovered, her character is the one I personally ended up feeling the most for. Sadly, today people hardly give this talented actress the recognition she deserves. 

Rajesh Khanna, on the other hand, is not consistently credible. He is very good at some scenes, but then quite terrible at others, struggling with a role that seems to be too demanding for him. The very first scenes of the film when he is accused of his wife's murder are quite an example to that, as he just shouts and screams very unnaturally that he is innocent. The supporting cast, however, is very good. Unsurprisingly, Iftekhar is the most impressive of the lot, getting a role that is more lengthy and substantial than the ordinary blink-and-miss parts he used to play in other films, and playing it with restraint and style. Bindu, Gajanan Jagirdar, Shammi, Sujit Kumar, among others, are all very good in smaller parts.

Towards the end the film does drag a bit, as it starts losing its sense of uncertainty and becomes rather predictable. The final sequences are more of a courtroom drama only that they take place in this very house. The ending discloses all the secrets and resolves all the conflicts in just a few shots, working a lot on convenience and being quite contrived. There are also some really cheesy dialogues which could have been avoided and this whole portion of the film feels too sugarcoated. That said, I frankly didn't expect something else because I had seen several of B.R Chopra's thrillers (who's the film's producer) and they had the same kind of ending. Ittefaq is overall a memorable and highly watchable suspense thriller.
